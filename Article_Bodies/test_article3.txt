No mass shootings else where? China...Mao...unarmed public....millions killed\
Russia....gulag....KGB...unknown number killed....unarmed public\
Balkans....Serb nationalism....thousands killed....unarmed public\
You can argue both sides until you are blue in the face, but the way this country's government acts I want to be able to protect those I love and my property.\
I also believe that this country has turned away from the concepts that made it great. The media has been complicit in this by promoting "headline" horror stories to increase market share or to scoop others.\
The latest shooting has just as much or more to do with the mental health crisis in this country than guns, but let's blame an inanimate item and not the user. It's part of the failure to make people take responsibility for their actions that is condoned by politicians and media both.\
To truly fix societies problems is our greatest challenge, using a type of firearm to blame ALL societies ills is not going to solve anything. If you are not promoting a broad fix to a social problem then you are promoting a narrow "headline" grabbing stance, then on to the next"headline".\
