James Shaw Jr  watched a kitchen employee stacking plates at the Waffle House in Antioch  Tennessee  The tower of porcelain plates was getting dangerously high  and James Shaw and his friend  from their table top seats  were ready for the loud clash of shattered plates  So when gunfire broke out  they initially shrugged it off as fallen plates  Then a second eruption  then a third  and glass ricocheted around the crowded room RELATED  COWARDLY ATTACK  Two police officers ambushed and killed while at lunch Employees panicked into a scatter  James Shaw  lept from his seat  toward the entrance  where a person lay bleeding  motionless  Earlier  Shaw had seen the killers silhouette in the gold Chevy Silverado outside  but shrugged it off  It was 3 30 in the morning  after all   There was no reason to assume that the 29 year old man inside the car was motivating himself for a shooting spree  Or that he was naked from the waist down  And especially not that he  less than a year ago  had been arrested by the Washington  DC Police outside the White House for unlawfully entering the area  which he told police he needed to inspect Shaw didnt know any of this  only that a man with an AR 15 was on the other side of the door The shooter killed four people  but he couldve killed many more  He couldve killed everyone in the restaurant  Luckily  James Shaw Jr  was there  This isnt about gun control  The shooter had lost his right to purchase or own guns  This is about the American spirit that James Shaw Jr  showed yesterday Jason Davis Getty Images ,0
Once again  the New York Times op ed section is masquerading as hard news  Yesterday  retired US Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens penned an op ed about gun control The 97 year old was one of four unsuccessful dissenters in the 2008 case  District of Columbia v  Heller  in which the Supreme Court determined that the Second Amendment does  in fact  guarantee a citizens right to possess firearms for self defense RELATED  Floridas new school safety bill does a lot of good until it craps on the Constitution Appointed by Richard Nixon  Stevens started his career as a Republican  but quickly led the liberal wing of the Supreme Court  and has been decorated for a legacy of championing progressive causes The media have described former Justice Stevens as a conservative  Another falsehood  Again  he opposed District of Columbia v  Heller In the New York Times op ed  Justice Stevens described the Second Amendment  which states that a well regulated militia  being necessary to the security of a free state  the right of the people to keep and bear arms  shall not be infringed  as little more than a relic of the 18th century He celebrated the high school renegades supposedly at the helm of the impressively funded March For Our Lives movement  Stevens claimed the high school protestors reveal the broad public support for legislation to minimize the risk of mass killings of schoolchildren and others in our society  The high school students  Justice Stevens wrote  should demand a repeal of the Second Amendment They should demand  Theyve been demanding  All they seem to do is demand   The narrative is becoming familiar  A ragtag band of high schoolers are leading a revolution against the gun toting boogeymen  Those kids are too young to see the irony in it They dont realize that the real boogeymen are the ones telling them what to say Allison Shelley Getty Images ,0

He is the most hated man in the world today Former Deputy Scot Peterson resigned yesterday after video surveillance showed that he was armed and stationed at Stoneman Douglas High School while the shooting took place   Instead of immediately addressing the target and putting an end to the rampage  Peterson cowered behind a concrete column in a stairwell The sheriff of Broward County suspended Peterson without pay pending an internal investigation  but the officer beat him to it  Peterson  knowing his fate  resigned and retired yesterday   This morning  police officers line Petersons home  They are guarding against anyone who wants to harm Petersonand thats a lot of people  The officers themselves probably dont even want to protect this coward But before we take up our pitchforks and torches and charge his door  lets remember something We werent there As much as we would like to think that we would be brave and execute a single kill shot to the Stoneman shooter before he could take 17 lives  would that actually play out in real life Would we be brave Would we have the courage We all hope we would  but you dont really know until you are in that situation   Im not trying to defend Petersons gutless inaction  I absolutely think he should have used his training to save lives that day Im just saying we arent him  We dont know what was going through his mind Peterson could have been a hero  but he made other choices   Now  he has to live with that guilt for the rest of his life   So before we call for blood  lets remember that he already has his punishment France is no longer free  Marion Le Pen took the stage at CPAC yesterday and spent the first several minutes of her speech destroying the EU  She lamented about lost sovereignty at the hands of Brussels and advocated the new global slogan  America First Britain First  and yes  FRANCE FIRST I searched around yesterday  after she left the stage  to see what people were saying  By and large  no one was saying a thing  The conservative media and voices were all but silent  Thats probably because everything she said sounded exactly like what Trump campaigned on in 2016  Anti EU and other large trade organizations  Check  Anti immigration  Check  Sceptical of Muslim migrants  Double check Now heres why this is so scary  All the issues I just said  mega trade alliances  immigration  AND Muslim migrants are ACTUAL legitimate issues  In fact  a big reason for why Trump won was because he gave voice to these concerns that  by and large  had been ignored for decades  If you watched Marion Le Pen yesterday  you saw something the new American right hasnt had in well ever  A young  female  photogenic firebrand  There she was at CPAC  flashing that million dollar smile  and giving the crowd EVERYTHING they wanted to hear  At one point a chant of VIVA LA FRANCE rang out over the conference hall Lets get one thing straight right now  The far right in Europe has absolutely NOTHING in common with American conservatism  These people and groups are ethno nationalist populists  The only thing theyre concerned with is using real issues  like trade  the economy and immigration  and focusing peoples rage  That right there is how monsters are born  Thats how they gain power  and when they get that power  they arent interested in reducing the size and scope of government  They expand it through control  a massive welfare state  and aggression  That right there is National Socialism There is a global effort among the far right to link themselves to the success of Donald Trump  Now  I get that they would want to try and emulate that success and ride our coattails  but we shouldnt be helping them do it  The European far right  which has more in common with the alt right than anything else  was actually giving a speech to American conservatives yesterday  Theyre being legitimized and co opted into the American right  This is dangerous  and we need to put a stop to it right now Abraham Lincoln said  I am a firm believer in the people   If given the truth  they can be depended upon to meet any national crisis   The great point is to bring them the real facts So  here are the real facts about the  NeverAgain movement and the upcoming March for Our Lives rally  planned for March 24th in Washington DC   All week  CNN and the rest of the media have portrayed this movement as grassroots and totally teen driven   Maybe it was in the very beginning   But its not anymore Last Sunday  less than a week after the horrible tragedy at Stoneman Douglas High School  junior Cameron Kasky set up a GoFundMe account to raise money for the March for Our Lives   Kasky is the teenager who confronted Senator Marco Rubio onstage at CNNs Monster Truck Rally event Wednesday night   So far  more than 25 000 people have donated over  2 million What is the money actually for   On the GoFundMe page  Kasky says  the funds will be spent on the incredibly difficult and expensive process that is organizing a march like this   We have people making more specific plans  but for now  know that this is for the march and everything left over will be going to the victims funds    The March for Our Lives has received an additional  2 million in pledges from George Clooney  Oprah Winfrey  Steven Spielberg  and Jeffrey Katzenberg Cameron Kaskys father said that Cameron and his friends are being directed by people with knowledge of how to responsibly spend this money and its going to be very transparent Hope it goes a lot better than George Clooneys September 11th fund Kaskys dad also said that with Clooneys help the teens have brought in some attorneys  some administrative help  and a public relations firm whose clients include Meryl Streep  Will Smith  Charlize Theron  and Woody Allen  among many other celebrities   Why do you need all that if this is such a grassroots thing  driven by teenagers   Because these are now 16 year olds with  4 million at their disposal Already  the March for Our Lives rally has a slick website selling merchandise   Make no mistake  this is a campaign      The new spokesman for the rally  yes  it already has a spokesman  says  Any leftover funds will go towards supporting a continuing  long term effort by and for young people to end the epidemic of mass shootings that has turned our classrooms into crime scenes   In other words  March for Our Lives is essentially a new gun control lobbying firm Now the teens have brought in Deena Katz to help organize the rally   Katz is the co executive producer of Dancing With the Stars   Oh  and she was also co executive director of the Los Angeles Womens March The rally is also being organized in collaboration with a nonprofit group called Everytown for Gun Safety   The advisory board of this group includes one former governor and six former mayors  all Democrats   It also includes Michael Bloomberg  Warren Buffett  and Kenneth Lerer  Leer  who helped start The Huffington Post  BuzzFeed  and a website called StoptheNRA com Kasky told CBS  At the end of the day  this isnt a red and blue thing   This isnt Democrats or Republicans   This is about everybody and how we are begging for our lives Perhaps Kasky truly feels that way  but hes getting a crash course in how American politics and media work   This may have started as a teen cause  but it has been hijacked by powerful forces on the Left with a very specific agenda MORE 3 THINGS  ,0
EDITOR'S NOTE  Jonathon Dunne is an Irishman with a lifelong dream of becoming an American citizen  After waiting for over 13 years  Dunne received a job offer from Glenn Beck so he could achieve his dream  but unfortunately  he did not meet the requirements to apply for a visa  Unless laws change or Dunne decides to break the law  he won't  his American dream is dead  Despite this setback  he still loves America and seeks to be a positive influence on society by promoting the idea of America and God given freedoms  While on a recent vacation  Dunne delivered sixteen presentations  for free  in eight different states across the U S  During this time  he kept notes and we asked him to share some of his experiences  As you read the column below  imagine the words are being spoken in a thick  Irish accent  If you're having trouble imagining how that sounds  you can hear it for yourself by tuning into Dunne's free weekly podcast   Freedom's Disciple  on TheBlaze Radio  available on SoundCloud  iTunes  iHeart Radio  Google Play and Stitcher Its 5am I am not an early riser  so most mornings I struggle to get out of bed  It is especially harder in the winter  its dark  its cold and the days are shorter I am also a believer that the snooze button is my best friend  every time my alarm goes off  I am convinced just eight more precious minutes will refresh me  I forget logic and reason at this moment  I forget that I have been asleep for six hours and am still tired  but I know just another 480 seconds will make that big difference Today is different Today  I lie in my bed wide awake  refreshed and ready to take on the world  I am lying in my bed looking at my iPad  waiting for it to go off and wondering whats taking so long  I watch as it goes from 4 58am to 4 59am and finally to 5am So why is today different  Today is the start of an exciting and a unique adventure  I feel like a child on Christmas morning  because today I will board a plane and head towards the only country I truly love  where I feel like I belong and that I long to call home As I rise and finish my packing  it becomes easy for my mind to wonder about the adventures that await me  I am excited to see some old friends again  intrigued at making new friends  as well as the prospect of visiting new places and experiencing different parts of Americas vast culture America has changed my life so much by providing answers to how life should be and its history has provided so much inspiration  The idea of America is the ultimate experiment of mankind at its finest  an example of freedom  hope and what people can achieve when they are free to pursue their dreams If I had to give America a slogan it would simply be America   making the impossible possible Behind all the excitement and joy is a sense of fear and apprehension  I experience these feelings every time I do a public speaking engagement  talk on my show or write a column What happens if I cannot give back to America by helping inspire someone as I have been inspired  What if I cant reach Americans and help them see their own great history and the principles that made America exceptional  What if I cant explain why both parties are on a path towards European style big government  which has never and will never work  How can I make a connection with people and help them understand the only solution is Americas Founding Principles  This is my constant challenge With the creation of social media  it is easier than ever before to learn the news of the day and share your reaction  Today  people on all sides love to get outraged  achieve social justice and destroy someone on the other side As I flew into JFK and had a five hour layover before my flight to RDU  I came across the latest outrage  which was an attack on capitalism There was a report of price gouging as someone was charging  100 for a case of water during the hurricane season  As you can imagine  there was plenty of outrage  calls for government regulation to make such practices illegal  demands for pricing controls  a resurgence of the narrative that all businesses are evil and probably a fancy hashtag campaign along the lines of  DownWithCapitalism Before I continue  let me state clearly I am not defending or promoting this price for a crate of water I know this may shock some people  but I believe in life  you are entitled to nothing  and you certainly do not have a right to any product regardless of your situation  If I own a crate of water  or any product or service  I can choose to sell it for any price I see fit  and you have a right to purchase it or decline my price If you understand economics  you know there are two ways this problem can be solved Firstly  the laws of supply and demand help determine the pricing of a product  if there is a surplus  prices go down  If there is a shortage they go up  If a business puts a price of  100 on a crate of water and enough people say no  eventually the business will have to reduce the price until enough people are happy and decide to purchase the water  because business cannot make a profit without sales The second way has to do with your personal mindset  A growing number of people today will look at a problem and that is all they will ever see  Others will see the problem and focus entirely on finding the solution and possibly get rewarded for their efforts In this case  if someone is charging  100 for a crate of water  it opens the door for a new or existing competitor offer a similar product for a cheaper price  Another business might still be profitable by selling crates of water for only  80 each  which would greatly disrupt the market  The original business would then have three choices  keep his pricing the same  match his competitors price or beat the price  This simple solution may result in a price war between the businesses  and generally  price wars lead to greater outcomes for the consumer If you truly care for the consumer and have their best interests at heart  the only solution is less government  less regulation and letting individuals innovate and compete with each other for the opportunity to make a profit Theres another reason I was frustrated by the outrage of the day  While sitting in JFK  I suddenly realized I had a price gouging situation of my own to deal with  and government regulations were making matters worse If you have traveled through an airport recently  you know government regulations with the assistance of the TSA make it illegal for you to bring any fluids through security gates  As a result of this regulated market  I ended up paying  8 04 for two bottles of Powerade at Hudson on the inside of the security gates Crazy  huh If you are doing the math  that adds up to nearly  90 for a crate Photo by Jonathon Dunne The above price list is from Hudson  and as you can see  a crate of water would cost  72 This happens every day to tens of thousands of passengers as they travel through JFK  and yet where is the outrage to fix this  Where is the fancy hashtag Thankfully  there is no outrage  because I was not really price gouged Nobody was beside me with a gun saying  you must buy this product at this price  and I could have said no  but I was thirsty and wanted a bottle of Powerade Hopefully one day  airports will be open to more competition  which will bring pricing down and then once again the consumer will win Until then  may the idea of America continue to see us through Screenshot   YouTube ,0
Christmas Day  2009  A man smuggled chemicals onto a Northwest Airlines flight with 289 passengers aboard This feat required the precision of a master technician and the stealth of a magician  One does not simply waltz onto a plane with a carry on full of deadly  flammable liquids  Too obvious  You might be mistaken for a terrorist  No  this top secret mission required months  or even minutes  of careful planning  It also took a steady hand  sometimes two  for the chemicals would have to be concealed where no government agent would think to explore The man made it through airport security with his concealed chemicals intact  Too easy  He thought of Richard Reid  the failed shoe bomber  Amateur  The flight from Amsterdam to Detroit seemed to last forever though  His nether regions were cramped and uncomfortable  He stashed the secret chemicals within the cotton confines of his underpants  He thought it was brilliant Finally  the plane descended toward Detroit  The man covered himself with a blanket and tried to light his skivvies  There was lots of smoke  but no fruit of the boom  just a burning sensation where you never want to feel a burning sensation Before he knew it  Umar Farouk and his singed underwear landed in maximum security federal prison with a life sentence for his brief attempt at mass murder And now he has a new burning sensation  a burning desire to communicate with his fellow citizens of the world  Except he says the U S  government is keeping him down  violating his First  Fifth and Eighth Amendment rights  Because now he cares about stuff like freedom and American Constitutional rights Last week he sued Uncle Sam for prohibiting him from having any communication whatsoever with more than 7 5 billion people  the vast majority of people on the planet He also says solitary confinement is inhumane and that hes not allowed to pray with fellow Muslims  Apparently  life in prison is proving to be even more restrictive than tightie whities for Umar 48 hours Thats how long the president of Zimbabwe  Robert Mugabe  held the position of Goodwill Ambassador The World Health Organization chose Mugabe because they thought he would be an advocate for fighting diseases such as cancer and diabetes in Africa Thankfully  someone at the World Health Organization returned to sanity and rescinded the appointment just two days later when they remembered  oh yeah  Mugabe is a violent  tyrannical despot To think that someone who helped spread a raging cholera epidemic in his own country would fight diseases is insane This is a man that has killed thousands of his own citizens for political dissent  destroyed Zimbabwes healthcare program  and eviscerated the agriculture system  His forced seizure of white owned farms collapsed the economy and has led to devastating poverty and mass starvation across the country Mugabe is single handedly responsible for reducing the life expectancy in Zimbabwe from 62 years to 36 the lowest in the world Believe me when I say  this is a man incapable of anything good This is a guy who aspired to be like Adolf Mugabe actually said  I am still the Hitler of the time  Hitler has only one objective  justice for his people  sovereignty for his people  recognition of the independence of his people and their rights over their resources  If that is Hitler  then let me be Hitler tenfold  Ten times  that is what we stand for How could the World Health Organization be so stupid Well  it wouldnt be the first time the United Nations honored Mugabe In 2012  the UN endorsed him as a Tourism Ambassador That title is ironic because Mugabes been banned from traveling to most parts of the world because of his atrocious human rights violations  Not to mention  there is nothing to tour in his own country of Zimbabwe except devastation  poverty  and disease If our intergovernmental organization insists on appointing Mugabe to something  it should be Ambassador to the Deepest  Darkest Recesses of Hell  I can get behind that appointment There is no safe space from partisan politics anymore  not even a Cub Scout den Eleven year old Cub Scout Ames Mayfield from Broomfield  Colorado  has been kicked out of his den  According to his mother  Lori  he was asked to move to another den because of the questions he asked a Republican State Senator who was speaking to his den Ames asked Republican Vicki Marble why she wont support  common sense gun laws  He also said  There is something wrong in our country where Republicans believe its a right to own a gun  but a privilege to have health care That sounds exactly like every eleven year old Ive ever been around  They all speak just like that Ames read his questions and lots of stats to the State Senator from stapled documents  He read for almost two and a half minutes before the Senator was able to respond  Naturally  Ames mom captured the whole thing on video and then posted it on social media None of us are perfect parents  but perhaps Mrs  Mayfield couldve thought ahead a little bit  that posting those videos online might stir up controversy and get local media involved  Maybe she couldve predicted that this whole thing might rub some Cub Scout leaders the wrong way Unless all this attention is precisely what she hoped for young Ames  and maybe for herself  After all  people might be more inclined to let a child finish their ridiculously long essay on pro gun control and pro government health care  than they would be inclined to listen to a middle aged mom with an ax to grind But I have to ask Mrs  Mayfield  was it worth it to deny your child his experience at Cub Scouts  Is he better off for being your political mouthpiece  Im no expert  but Im pretty sure hed rather be playing with his friends at Scouts than home memorizing liberal talking points with you MORE 3 THINGS  ,0
In November of last year  India banned certain cash notes in a bold move to force businesses into the banking system to better harvest more taxes from its livestock  Now  under the guise of improving transparency and forming a common market  India has begun targeting gold with new taxes  regulation  and incentives for citizens to turn over their undeclared gold to the financial sector Roughly 86  of Indias economic activity happened in cash at the time much of it was banned  Presumably that includes the  19 billion per year retail gold industry  Again  it appears that Indias government  central bankers  wants a bigger cut of the action and to better track the private assets of citizens Bloomberg has been reporting that Indias government is teaming up with crony gold dealers to plan a complete revamp of its gold policy  which is always code for control  regulate and tax READ FULL ARTICLE   ,0
Editors Note  The following is a guest post by Charles Hugh Smith with PeakProsperity com In the modern era  the phrase Class War is rooted in the socialist Marxist concept that the conflict between labor  the working class  and capital  owners of capital  is not just inevitableits the fulcrum of history   In this view  this Class War is the inevitable result of the asymmetry between the elite who own control the capital and the much larger class of people whose livelihood is earned solely by their labor In Marxs analysis  the inner dynamics of capitalism inevitably lead to the concentration of capital in monopolies cartels whose great wealth enables them to influence the government to serve the interests of capital  Subservient to capital  the laboring class must overthrow this unholy partnership of capital and the state to become politically free via ownership of the means of production  i e  productive assets This Class War did not unfold as Marx anticipated  The laboring class gained sufficient political power in the early 20th century to win the fundamentals of economic security  universal public education  labor laws that prohibited outright exploitation  the right to unionize  and publicly funded pensions The alternative explanation for this wave of progressive policies is that prescient leaders of the capital state class ushered in these reforms as the only alternative to the dissolution of the status quo   Labor reforms began in Germany and Great Britain in the late 19th century Gilded Age  and another wave of reforms were enacted in the decade long crisis of capitalism in the Great Depression Though the conventional view is that this failure of capitalism to devolve as expected proves Marxs analysis is without merit  it can also be argued that the state capital partnership was far more flexible than early Marxists anticipated  sharing enough of the wealth generated in the industrial revolution with the laboring class to enable a stable  productive middle class benefited the state capital class by creating a new strata of consumers  of goods  services and credit  who greatly enriched industrial and financial capitalists and the state  which could raise unprecedented sums in payroll and income taxes Basking in the luxury of hindsight  its easy for us in the present day to forget the often violent struggles between labor and capital that characterized the early 20th century  anarchists bombed Wall Street  and the Powers That Be sent in armed forces to suppress efforts to unionize entire swaths of industrial workers While the middle class of professionals  small business owners  traders and entrepreneurs can be traced back to the birth of modern capitalism in the 15th century  the emergence of a mass middle class of tens of millions of wage earners with the purchasing and borrowing power created by stable employment was a unique feature of 20th century capitalism In effect  the middle class was the Grand Truce in the class war  the states imposition of regulations and a social safety net on unfettered capital resolved labor and capitals primary conflict by sharing the output of capitalisms bounty Many assets had to be put in place to enable this vast distribution of wealth to tens of millions of laborers  a cheap  abundant source of energy  fossil fuelscoal  oil and natural gas  an efficient  accessible transportation network  a financial system that could extend credit to millions of households  and a government with the tax revenues and resources to fund public works that were too risky or out of reach for private sector capital In the latter third of the 20th century  the permanence of this version of state capitalism was unquestioned  laborers would always be able to enter the middle class  and opportunities for advancement would always be open to those with middle class access to education and credit There was no compelling reason to believe this consensus was about to fray and potentially dissolve  and no reason to think that rather than being a permanent feature of advanced capitalism  the middle class was a one off based on cheap energy  surging productivity and the boost phase of credit expansion But now income and wealth inequality are rising sharply  and capital is pulling far ahead of labor  which is creating a vast and quickly widening divide between the classes Class Warfare  Its More Than Just Income Fast forward to today  and an unexpected series of class wars are emerging as this longstanding social contract frays  social mobility has declined  fostering a divide between the traditional working class  also known as the lower middle class  which finds itself increasingly exposed to the corrosive winds of globalization and neoliberal policies  and the upper middle class of highly educated professionals and technocrats who have benefited from these policies  securing protected employment in higher education  government and Corporate America Commentator Peggy Noonans influential essay described Americas nascent class war as pitting the protected classthose with secure pay and benefits against the unprotected class of those with insecure employment and benefits In other words  the divisive economic issue is not simply the quantity of each classs income and wealth  but the quality of their respective economic security   For example  if an unprotected household earns  80 000 in wages and  30 000 in benefits in a good year of full employment in benefits rich jobs  and  30 000 in wages and no benefits in the following not so good year of zero benefits part time work  their average total earnings are  70 000 per yeara very respectable middle class income But compare the difficulties posed by losing healthcare benefits and getting by on a  50 000 decline in wages vs the secure  70 000 earned year after year after year by a protected household Consider the anxieties burdening the insecure household of two workers who cannot count on having benefits and full time employment  who see their savings or retirement accounts built up in good years drained in bad years  Houses bought in good years are forced into foreclosure in bad years To take another example  compare the security of a tenured professor in higher education with the insecure zero benefits earnings of an adjunct professor whose annual teaching contract is subject to cancelation or modification every year of his her career Not only is the adjunct paid about half the salary of the tenured professor  when the adjunct nears retirement age  he she has no pension other than Social Security  while the tenured professor has an ample retirement package of pension and healthcare coverage  Both taught the same courses  but one faces a sunset of poverty or the need to keep working far past the conventional retirement age of 65  while the other can retire comfortably and continue teaching or doing research for satisfaction rather than financial necessity Class Warfare  Economic and Cultural This widening gap between the Protected and the Unprotected is not just economic  its also cultural The Mobile Cosmopolitans who secure protected positions have little exposure to the challenges of the unprotected  whom they typically interact with only as an employer giving instructions to maids  nannies  dog walkers  waiters  etc   Sociologist Charles Murray described this widening cultural gap in his 2012 book Coming Apart  The State of White America  19602010   Murray made the case that Americas cultural elitethe mobile  highly educated and largely urban upper middle class  i e  the protected classis a reservoir of the traditional values  marriage  attending church  setting goals  etc  that are fading in working class unprotected America Murray posited that various behaviors and associations characterize each class  The working class  for example  volunteers to serve in the U S  military  while the elites are in civilian positions of power  for example  those who order the working class volunteers into Americas permanent wars  The working class attend NASCAR races  the elite class pursues cultural enrichment  and so on While many commentators view Murrays conclusions as overly negative  the recent presidential election has heightened the cultural divide he described between Hillary Clintons deplorables  who President Obama chided for their attachment to guns and Jesus  and the self described  and oh so morally superior  progressives The word is in parentheses because I have suggested that these self anointed betters are at best fake progressives  as they support exploitive neoliberal policies that are anything but progressive Its painfully obvious that the economic division between protected and unprotected overlays all too well on Murrays cultural divisions The upper middle progressive class has the sort of social financial mobility and securityboth higher quantities of income and wealth and higher qualities of securitythat are out of reach of most of the countrys much larger number of unprotected households All the advantages that accrue to the upper middle classsocial mobility  access to higher education minus the crushing burdens of student loan debt  family and social connections that lead to lucrative careers  parents who can afford to give their offspring cars and down payments for homesare accretive  each reinforces the others The intensity of lifes challenges is considerably different for each class  With higher income and greater security  such as having stable healthcare insurance  the protected class can afford to take better care of themselves  they have multiple layers of financial cushions against lifes inevitable difficulties such as layoffs  illnesses that require sick leave costly procedures  auto accidents  etc For the protected elites  the intensity of these challenges is lessened by financial and social resources  Social connections lead to new employment in the same profession  gold plated healthcare insurance covers most of the costs of illness  and ample auto insurance replaces the wrecked vehicle with minimum disruption Meanwhile  to the unprotected household  each of these difficulties is potentially devastating  a secure job may never be replaced  an illness may lead to bankruptcy  and the loss of a reliable vehicle may cripple the households ability to get to work and earn the money needed to buy another car The social contract of the 20th century established state funded safety nets for those who experience layoffs and medical emergencies  But these programs were by and large designed to provide temporary aid to those who were getting back on their feet As the foundations of middle class mobility and security erode  these programs are now morphing into permanent  lifelong welfare systems  This is creating new social stresses and divisions The Pitchforks Are Being Sharpened But this protected vs  unprotected isnt the only Class War thats brewing In Part 2  The Class War Playbook we show why the shrinking resource pieof cheap energy  of cheap debt  of labors share of the economy  of the low hanging fruit of globalizationwill soon cleave any mass movement into competing classes Our complex  interdependent civil society will spawn equally complex and interdependent class conflicts as a result  In short  there wont be one class war  there will be many  raging across social  political and economic battlefields Understanding how these many wars will be waged is critical to surviving them intact Read

might contain errors DOC   Hi  there   Im Doc Thompson in for Glenn Beck   Thanks so much for joining me today   Were taking your tweets  DocThompsonshow  as we do during my regular morning radio broadcast on TheBlaze Radio Network    More about me  go to TheBlaze com  click on channels   And if you would  please follow my channel at TheBlaze com   Just again  right at the top  youll see channels and scroll down   And please pay no attention to the picture of me    Somehow  some way of all the press shots that theyve taken over the years  they said  Lets see if we can find the worst possible picture   Now  Im not saying any of them are really good   I realize youre starting with this   I get that   Thats cool Kal  have you seen the picture that they have up there on this KAL   I did   You look a little  whats the word DOC   I look like Im begging for gruel  like Im Oliver Twist    Please can I have more   Hello   Hello   Can I have some KAL   And the smirk on your face  I got to say  its kind of douchey   You got a bit of a douchey smirk DOC   Its a very douchey smirk   It looks like Im in pain or passing gas  like I didnt hear the question    What   What KAL   Do you get final approval on the photos they use DOC   No   They just put it up there   Its horrible   Look at this   Its horrible    But of all of that  somebody said  either this was the first one in the whole series of photos  and they just said  Theres the one   Found one of Doc   Good   Or theyre like  Lets go through and find one  and somebody thinks that looks good    If that somebody is a female around here  I really question your taste   I really  Im starting to think that theres somebody working against me in the company   I think somebody is like  Lets take him down   Do everything bad   All right   First  well start with a really bad photo   So  please  pay no attention to the photo   And  instead  just follow the page The tweets coming in   Its RINO Season tweeting   And when Obama says the police acted stupidly  he was doing race relations a solid   Is that right Yeah  see  thats the point   He has done so many things wrong when it comes to race relations  and now hes suddenly above it  as hes leaving office  that hes done everything right    One of the comments he made in the interview he just presented was  and Im paraphrasing here  but it was something to the effect of   By every measure  everything is much better now in America By every measure or metric  any way you could judge America  everything is better now compared to when he took office I could come up with a whole lot of things that are not better  a whole lot of things that are worse   In fact  I saw today  the VA  look at the VA alone    If he said  Wow  we put McDonald in  and everything is great   They got those wait times    First of all  the wait times that theyre reporting are not accurate wait times   All they did  instead of actually lower the amount of times that veterans have to wait  all they did was change the system or way that they measure them  the way they calculate it   So it seems like theyre better   The people arent actually getting in sooner   They just started measuring or counting different Its just a different formula that makes them look better   In fact  they rate  theres a service that rates veterans hospitals   And they rate them one to five stars   Five being the best  one star being the worst   And there are multiple hospitals  veterans hospitals around the country that went from a certain amount of stars to lesser stars    I know it was  off the top of my head  Albuquerque  and one in Colorado  went from two stars to one star   But by every metric  things are better in America today   Race relations   The economy Relations  in general  are they better today   We all getting along much better than we did in 2008   Health care  is that better   More money   By virtually no metric is it better I know one metric its better in America today   Its better for Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama   Its better for them   Because they are loaded   Lots of power and lots of money All right   Another tweet   DocThompsonshow from Ken Putt   Im completely with you  but maybe its time to switch to APR coffee  decaf APRCoffee is American Pride Roasters   Its the official coffee of TheBlaze   AmericanPrideRoasters com  they have the gift packets   Its the best coffee in America   Try it    But hes saying maybe I switched to their decaf   And Im sorry  its only American Pride Roasters  and its the Doc Thompsons Bacon Blast Coffee today   Mmm   Thats good stuff Okay   Before the break  we had a lady challenge and say  Okay   Whats the solution   I offered one   We need to stop paying attention to this stuff  start treating people well   And the people that dont treat you well  move on   Stop thinking that they have some ulterior racist motive   Sometimes its a misunderstanding   But theres another way forward Race relations in America  and I have expressed this on my morning radio broadcast from time to time  could be centered around food    Who doesnt like food  and who doesnt like ethnic foods   You may not like all ethnic foods   But youre going to probably like some ethnic foods    Kal  is there any ethnic food that you like that has nothing to do with your ethnicity or ethnic background   Anything at all KAL   Of course   My favorite food   Mexican   I love Mexican food    DOC   Youre not Mexican    KAL   Im nowhere near Mexican DOC   So imagine somebody said  You know  Kal  you have to accept Mexicans along with Mexican foods   I mean  thats a package deal   Even if you were racist  wouldnt you be like   Okay   Im going to go ahead and take the food   Ill just go ahead and accept them KAL   Why wouldnt I accept them DOC   Well  Im saying if you were a racist KAL   Oh  okay   So youre telling me  if Im a racist  I could eat my favorite kind of food  Mexican food  if I accept Mexicans DOC   Im just saying  you start calling the racists out   And youre like  Okay   So you dont like certain races  whatever  but you certainly love some of their food  dont you    Im saying  we dont know each other  and we start breaking bread with people  you dont like Asian people   So you dont like that Japanese cuisine   You dont like Thai food   Really  seriously   Youre racist    See  what Im saying   Then we get together   We start learning about it   Because food is also culture   So they start learning about people and understanding them   So Im thinking thats part of the key   Food solves so many other problems KAL   Food knows no boundaries DOC   Right   Exactly   It solves so many other problems   I think you do  you have the food summits   Thats how you need to start leading   And actually that has been the case in some ways throughout history in America    For example  for many years  most of the immigrants to America were primarily from Europe   They were from places like Italy and Germany and Ireland   Places like this    And the Irish are always going to fail here because Irish food basically sucks   I mean  by comparison  its just not good   So maybe its not going to work so good for the Irish   But  is there a whole lot of racism against Irish people right now    I mean  the gingers there are  but thats not exclusively Irish   Right   Okay    But for years  there was racism against people like from Italy and people from Germany  for example    After World War II  when you had American soldiers that were traipsing all over Europe as part of their efforts in Europe  they come back to America  and theyre like  Hey  so I have this stuff   Its called pizza  right   You got to try this stuff    People in America didnt know what pizza was   And then they would go into areas of New York where there were  or other major cities  where there were Italian communities  seeking out such cuisines  and they got to know about it   And how many real  real claims of and accurate claims of racism against Italians are there in America today Oh  come on   Italian lives matter   You dont have that   What do you have   You have Hispanic and black primarily are the claims of racism in America   At one time  a lot of Italians claimed racism   And maybe there was The food helped bring us together    My father  when he was  grew up in the hills of West Virginia   And he was probably 15  14  something like this   Shortly after World War II  his sister took a trip to New York   His older sister   And she came back  and she told him about this wonderful food called pizza   He had no concept of it   And she described it to him   And he said at the time  he goes  I thought it sounded horrible   Its bread with sauce on it   I dont  what is  it sounds horrible   He couldnt  he like couldnt even put it together in his head    And  of course  pizza is one of the biggest cuisines in America   We even recognize it as pretty much an American cuisine So  Kal  I think that food could be one of those ways forward   Think about all the foods around the world you love   All the ethnic cuisines   Thats part of the solution to it KAL   Totally   I think we can bring all people together with the food DOC   Thats it    I love food from all over the place   If I thought for a moment that it wasnt a package deal  I even learn about the cultures  or you just use food to say  Hey  think about all the stuff you learn about China from the fortune cookies when youre eating KAL   Before you even start a conversation  just  Here  try this    Automatically  theyre going to be put in a good mood   Wow  this is really good DOC   This is really good   Thats right   And you know whose that is   Let me tell you about these people So Ireland is at a disadvantage there  I admit it   Ethiopia probably at a disadvantage too KAL   Whats wrong with potatoes   You can have fried potatoes  baked potato  mashed potatoes    DOC   Yeah  and some of that is okay   But you got to understand  western European food  they dont cook with a lot of spices and stuff   A little bit bland   There are some exceptions   Not horrible   But  I mean  by comparison  and  by the way  Im of Irish and German descent or whatever  so  but by comparison  they lose when it comes to Italian food   Am I wrong KAL   I mean  if youre going on full on meals  I guess theyre not as exciting    DOC   Kal  lets go out for Irish food tonight   Kal  lets go out for Italian tonight KAL   I can go for some corned beef and hash and mashed potatoes   Thats good stuff DOC   Yes  you can go for it   But  Kal  heres your choice   We go Mexican  we go Italian  we go Thai  we go Irish food   Rate those for me KAL   Yeah  okay   Youre right   Irish is not going to be the top on the list DOC   All right   Thats it    All right   Students at the Ohio State University were asked recently by my friend  Faith Goldy  some questions about the terrorists   Well  of course  we had the terrorist attack in Berlin  which is still continuing to unfold this morning   Quick update on that  before I get to the Ohio State story Now it looks like there was two drivers or two people in the vehicle   The gentleman that was killed  likely  possibly  probably was hijacked   He was carjacked   They believe the truck  based on their tracking equipment and computers  that somebody tried to start it a couple of times and failed   Maybe without a key or whatever   Tried to get it started   And then at some point  it ended up starting    It drove toward Berlin for an hour or so  stopped for a couple of hours  and then eventually plowed through the crowd   And then the Polish gentleman  who was likely carjacked or something  was found dead   We dont know how he ended up  they havent confirmed if it was self inflicted  if the guy who carjacked him or the guy who was with him shot him  if a police officer did   They havent told us that yet   The other guy is still on the lam   Hes still out there   They say hes armed and dangerous   The gentleman that they picked up to begin with turned out to not be the guy    So this is whats going on   A couple of weeks ago  a few ago  I guess its probably close to a month ago now  at the Ohio State University  right around Thanksgiving  a guy in a car tried to pull off a  well  I guess it was a terrorist attack   He wasnt as successful as some    And in the car  plows into some people   Gets out of the car   Jumps out and starts stabbing people    Faith Goldy goes there and says  In light of whats happened there and some of these other automobile attacks  people using their car as a weapon or vehicle as a weapon  lets go talk to the people and find out what they think about this guy who  based on his rants on social media  what we know about him  and ISIS claiming responsibility for  was likely motivated by extremist beliefs   Extremist Islamic beliefs   Not that all Muslims believe this   Not that all Muslims are a part of this nonsense   They are not    By percentage  very few are   But its wrong to ignore the motivations to this stuff So she went and said  Hey  what do you think about this   Tell me about this guy   Do you think this was terrorism   Ask them all kinds of questions   Heres what some of the students at the Ohio State University had to say when she asked VOICE   Im here at Ohio State University  which has just become the setting of ISISs most recent terrorist attack on  DOC   Scroll in just a little bit   Scroll in about 30 seconds or so to this VOICE   Multiculturalism VOICE   Do you feel safe on campus after the attack this week VOICE   Yep VOICE   You do    Would you call it a terrorist attack VOICE   Depends on what your definition of terrorism is VOICE   According to your definition VOICE   No DOC   Okay   Wait   Wait   Wait   Would you call it a terrorist attack    It depends on what your definition of terrorism is What  is there another definition of terrorism I dont know   I mean  is it because he wasnt more successful    It depends on what your definition of terrorism is I assume that there was really only one standard   So you mean my definition  like  Kal  help me out here KAL   Im guessing  you know  attacking  hurting  killing DOC   Yes  he did those things   He did all of those things   Yeah  he was responsible for that   It was based on extremist ideology KAL   Uh huh   Uh huh   Not going to say like tickling falls under terrorism DOC   Oh   Is there some way this wouldnt be called terrorism   If he  what   If he wasnt motivated by extremist ideology KAL   Perhaps DOC   No  it could still be likely terrorism   Okay   A little bit more from the Ohio State University students VOICE   No VOICE   Would you call what happened terrorism VOICE   I dont see  I dont know what happened   I dont know what its about   And I think we still have a lot to learn about the incident VOICE   ISIS has claimed responsibility VOICE   I do realize that   But that doesnt always mean thats what necessarily happened VOICE   Would you call this terrorism VOICE   Im not sure DOC   Okay   Hold on a second   This guy  he wants to get all the answers   I dont know   I havent read everything yet   I just want to make sure that I dont say something thats inaccurate   Get all of the facts    Which I agree with   Thats great   I wonder how he feels about Russian hacking during the election   Did he say that as well   Did he also say  Well  we dont know for sure   Lets wait till all the information comes out   I would guess probably not   Heres a bit more VOICE   Im not sure   Ive been just kind of like keeping updated with the news   Im not sure like if theyve confirmed that  DOC   Okay   Hold on a second   So she doesnt know because shes been keeping up with the news   Didnt she just say she has been keeping up with the news  but she doesnt know    So is that a criticism of the news   They havent given her enough information   Okay   A little bit more VOICE   Yeah  so I dont know VOICE   Would you call what happened terrorism VOICE   No  I wouldnt VOICE   No VOICE   I would say it was a misunderstanding DOC   Okay   Theres the one   It wasnt terrorism   It was a misunderstanding   Thats all it was You know all the times that I have run people over and stabbed them  it was just a misunderstanding   Thats all it was   It certainly wasnt terrorism   It was just confusion   I thought it was perfectly acceptable to run people over and stab them I mean  Kal  all the times youve killed people  misunderstanding KAL   Luckily  I havent killed people recently DOC   Oh KAL   But I wouldnt think that that could be something that could be misunderstood though DOC   Im trying to think  what type of misunderstanding could there have been   KAL   You know  if your wife says  Hey  pick up some lemons  and I bring home limes   Oh  Im sorry  I misunderstood DOC   Right   That seems a little lighter   Uh huh   Uh huh KAL   Although  Id be in a lot of trouble   But I cant see how running people over and then getting out of the car and stabbing them  DOC   Maybe   Maybe your wife said  Hey  can you go to the store for lemons  and you thought she said  Hey  can you hit somebody with your car and then jump out and stab them   Lemons   Hit somebody with your car  jump out  and stab them   Very similar   Something like that  you know KAL   No   Not really similar at all  actually DOC   Hmm   Maybe it was like this  KAL   I mean  I know theres lost in translation  but this is a bit much DOC   Could be   But Im thinking  maybe it was something like  hey  you know  if you run into Steve today  tell him I said hi   If you run into Janice  KAL   Oh  I could see what youre saying  if you translate or misunderstand  you actually literally run into them    DOC   Right   Literally ran into Paul or Steve    Can you do me a favor   You know  if you run into Steve  give him this information    I dont know how the stabbing comes in   Maybe its  hey  if you run into Steve  jump out of the car and stab him a couple of times   Maybe its something like that   Hmm   So its a misunderstanding KAL   I dont think this guy knows what the definition of misunderstanding is DOC   I dont know how you would ever misunderstand such things Okay   Im going to get a break in   Well come back with more of what the students of the Ohio State University believe about this terrorist on this the Glenn Beck Program break DOC   Students at the Ohio State University asked by Faith Goldy a bunch of questions about the guy who jumped  ran people over with his car around Thanksgiving   Jumped out of the car and started stabbing people   Whether or not its racist   And the last gentleman said  No  it was just a misunderstanding    They had this  as I touched on at the beginning of the show  they had a  a memorial service for all people of color that have been killed recently  within months or whatever  by police officers   And they said  just because somebody has done something wrong  it doesnt mean that police officers should execute them   Paraphrasing   But that was the point of it   That police shouldnt just try them   But what theyre missing about this case was  police werent just trying him they were stopping him from killing other people   It didnt matter   Ill share that story with you in just a minute   Its Doc Thompson in for Glenn Beck at the Glenn Beck Program break DOC   Doc Thompson in for Glenn today   Thank you so much for joining me   Coming up on my radio broadcast in the morning on TheBlaze Radio Network  Friday morning  Im going to let the cat out of the bag and tell a bunch of company secrets Until they stop me   So coming up Friday morning  theres been a lot of questions about whats going on with the radio network   A lot of good stuff   But Ill tell you  some of the stuff going on  cat out of the bag  Friday morning   So please make an appointment now   Friday morning  Blaze Radio Network   6 00 to 9 00 Eastern time   Just go to TheBlaze com   Click on radio So the Ohio State University Coalition for Black Liberation  whatever that is  headed this memorial for people of color that were killed by police officers recently   And a young lady stood up and read this   She said  in some cases  the deceased may have committed acts of violence against others before they were killed   Perhaps they were domestic abusers   Perhaps they were threatened or killed other people   She said  this possibility is not something to shy away from   The protest against police brutality extends to the innocent and the guilty alike  because we know no matter the crime  justice and due process do not come from a cops bullet   Which is true   Thats the reason that police do not just go out and execute people    And they didnt execute this guy   The guy who drove his car into a group of people and started stabbing people was stopped by a police officer Did she miss that piece of the story   So it would have been better for the police officer to allow him to go on stabbing people  or does she believe they should have subdued him a different way   I love when they say  well  you didnt have to shoot him   You know  like deadly force   Can you just shoot him in the leg   Can you shoot him in the arm or something to stop him   No  you cant Thats not how it works  folks   Police officers are trained   If you pull your gun and you shoot somebody  you shoot to kill and thats it   Theres no wound them   This isnt Hollywood   You watch too many movies And if your loved one or you were being stabbed  would you really concern  now  hang on  police officer   Oh  Im being stabbed  hang on   Dont   No  dont shoot him   No  no  no   Try  just wing him   Hold on   No  no   Use your Taser    No   Youre going to say  Stop this guy   And thats what they did  and thats what they were supposed to do There is an associate professor of English   Her name is  sound effect   She said  KAL   Im sorry   What was that DOC    sound effect   Thats her name KAL   Is that the professional pronunciation DOC   Yeah  its a foreign name  so its not going to make sense to you    Sound effect   She said  you can understand where an act of violence comes from without condoning it    I was like  Okay   I guess you can understand that   You know  right   Nobody wants to be a criminal   And you could say  hey  this guy  inaudible But that doesnt mean you lead with  hey  this guy had a rough life  dont shoot him   Hes stabbing people  so lets think about it before we shoot him    No  stop him from hurting people   And then you dont lead with  okay   Now lets talk about how rough this guy had it   You talk about what was wrong   What he did wrong   The fact that it was terrorism   The motivation for the terrorism   The victims You talk about all these things before you go  Wow  this guy probably sucked   Right Then she called what he did a tragic  tragic mistake   He drove into the people and it was just a tragic mistake    Stephanie Clemance Thompson  cousin Stephanie who is an associate director of residency there said that the gentleman in question  the terrorist  sound effect  was a Buckeye   This was  KAL   Sorry  one more time DOC    sound effect   Again  a foreign name  Kal   Youre not going to understand it    She posted on social media   Hes a Buckeye  a member of our family   If you think its okay to celebrate his death and or share pictures of his dead body  if I see it in my time line  I will unfriend you   Because hes a Buckeye    Buckeyestrong   BlackLivesMatter    So thats her concern   That youre posting pictures  youre mocking him   You know why people are posting pictures and mocking him   Because theyre upset  theyre frustrated  theyre scared  theyre angry   All of these things  based on his actions   Not on his race   His ideas   His religion   None of this stuff She said  I pray you will find compassion for his life  as troubled as it clearly was   Think of the pain he must have been under to feel his actions were the only solution    Now  I mentioned the Brock Turner thing   Do they say the same thing when it comes to Brock Turner or rapists   Do they ever say  Wait a minute  lets give the racist some credit here   Im sure they dont want to be racist   What are they going through in their life   They must have really been jonesing for some strange in order to go out and rape somebody  right   They were just looking for a hookup   No  they dont say that   They say  No  its wrong   No means no   They never say nice things about it  Lets take their past into consideration   They never say any of that stuff   They say simply  Its wrong   Why the double standard   Because it doesnt fit the agenda These people say they need safe spaces from perception   Their perceptions of you and me and things you say   Perceived slights   Perceived insults   No  I mean  sometimes they actually are insults   But their safe spaces have not been strictly limited to that   And many times  in many cases  theyll say  Well  I think he meant this  or I believe that  or I thought I heard So they need safe spaces from the perceived harsh words that you or somebody else present   But terrorists  they dont need safe spaces from that   He needs to be understood   Dont shoot him because thats just executing him So their safe spaces are for words   Meanwhile  when they are actually in danger and in jeopardy  they dont need a safe space  its good What kind of twisted logic is that   What kind of nonsense is that I cannot wrap my head around it   So I was taught sticks and stones break my bones  words wont hurt me   Theirs is completely flipped around   It is   Words will hurt me  and a knife and a car will not   Vehicular assault  thats good   That actually wont hurt me   Come on  kids    You were just run over and stabbed   Pick yourself up  dust yourself off   What do I tell you   Words and names may cause you pain  but cars and knives  they wont hurt you   So just suck it up Its just bizarre Hey  did you see the Oscars have a possibility  for the first time in history  of having somebody win both the male and female best acting categories laughter Somebody has been nominated for both the male and female best acting category   Kelly Mantle was born a male  but plays a transgender prostitute in Confessions of a Womanizer   Whatever that is   And Mantle calls himself an actor on Instagram  but also appeared in RuPauls Drag Race   Whatever that is   And has also said that he  she is gender fluid   Not just transitioning   Because transitioning would say  I was born a man  but Ive always known Im a woman   So he would only be by their progressive Hollywood logical a female and  therefore  eligible for the female category But hes gender fluid   So at any given moment  he could be male or female   He just vacillates back and forth   So I imagine if they nominate him for both categories  at any moment  he may not fit that category   But he may again in a minute  a day later   So I imagine it would go like this He  this person is in the audience   Right   Okay   The best actress award goes to  and at that moment  hes probably female  making him eligible to win   And then he would win it   And  yes  I won   But then as they get ready to read the male winner  probably gender fluid over to the male category   Hes gender fluid Producers say they werent sure what category to put him in because when they years ago split the reminder list  this is a list that they send out to all the people that vote in the Academy  this little controlled group  into male and female categories   And he fits both since hes gender fluid    So they said  Just put him in both   Just easier   Just put him in both since hes gender fluid   We dont know what he is today   Throw him in both   And who knows  he may fit that    You know  I dont agree with or fully understand people that say they are transgender   I try to  and I say  Wow  that must be really horrible  if you feel this  you know  youve always been trapped in somebody elses body   I can empathize  sympathize with them and say  That sucks   I dont wish you any ill will   You have a right to live your life   I dont want to keep you down   Go forth with personal freedoms and personal responsibility and live your life   And if you grant me the same respect  well have a fine relationship I can  it must suck if you want to go into a certain restroom   I get all that   The simple solution to restrooms are you just make them all unisex   One person   One bathroom   And there you go   Move on   So we can move on    But gender fluid  I got to call foul on   That one Im calling foul on   Thats BS   That is definitely BS   If youre gender  let me help you out  if youre gender fluid or believe youre gender fluid  youre female   No  no  if you cannot make up your mind  youre female   Guys can make up their mind   No guy is saying  You know  today  Im just feeling kind of effeminate   Today  I just need help   Today  I just need some understanding and chocolate  okay   I just need that   Im not looking for you to solve my problems   I just want to you listen   No guy is saying that Guys know  males know  even women who say theyve been transitioning to a male always felt like they were trapped in a female body  but they identify as male  they know   They know theyre male   Women dont know   Women are the ones who  Today I just need to be held   The other  You know  if you think you can keep me down  what do you think I need a male   I need a man like a fish needs a bicycle   Youre the one vacillating   Right   Thats what Im saying If you believe youre gender fluid  help me out  youre female   Youre gender female   Thats just how it is Kal  based on your experiences as a married man  do you dispute what I say KAL   No   No  not at all   Pretty much  you nailed it down right there laughter No misunderstanding DOC   No misunderstandings Does your wife ever not fully have an answer  or is she ever undecided  Kal KAL   No DOC   Does she ever change her mind   Is she ever fluid about where youre going to go to dinner  where the couch in the living room should go  what youre buying for Christmas  where youre vacationing  how to rear the child KAL   If shes asking that question  no  she always knows   If youre asking that question  eh  sometimes theres some variations   Theres some questions DOC   Uh huh   So today she knows exactly how she wants the living room setup  right   The couch goes in a certain corner KAL   Yes  she does   Uh huh DOC   Is that static   Will she have that same idea six months from now KAL   No   She will  DOC   So she is feng shui fluid KAL   Yes   Very feng shui fluid DOC   Okay KAL   Feng fluid    DOC   She is interior design fluid KAL   Yes    DOC   And what about what you should be consuming and what she is going to consume  what youre going to have for dinner tonight   Is she ever  is she always static about her decisions KAL   No DOC   Okay   See  same thing   Hence  women dont make up their mind   Theyre fluid about many things   If you believe youre gender fluid  you are simply gender female   Quick break   Back with more on this   The Glenn Beck Program OUT AT 9 50AM DOC   Hey  if you would

The real problem facing America has nothing to do with globalization or globalists  It has nothing to do with nationalism or internationalism  Our real problem is ideas in direct conflict with the Constitution  socialism  communism and progressivism  These misleading labels basically mean the same thing  total and complete government control   Many people are asking the wrong questions to resolve our problem I contend we are having the argument that Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt were having 100 years ago  Is the national socialist better or the international socialist better  The question has to be  Is the Constitution the answer  Glenn said Thursday on radio The Constitution is the framework that outlines and defines what our government can and cannot do    The Constitution will stop you from doing all kinds of things  like meddling in peoples lives  like telling them who they can and cannot marry  or how they can and cannot run their business  unless its dangerous  The Constitution stops the meddling in international affairs and stops globalism dead in its tracks  Glenn explained    Read below or listen to the full segment for answers to these equally insightful questions  How do we get beyond personalities and talk about the issues  Why did Lenin coin the term democratic socialist  How is the Constitution like a combustion engine  What does Natures Law mean  Is the Bill of Rights part of the Constitution  How did the words in the Declaration of Independence help free slaves Listen to this segment from The Glenn Beck Program Below is a rush transcript of this segment  it might contain errors GLENN   I want to talk to you a little bit about  we had a guy call us a few minutes ago   And he wanted to give me a lesson on the reason why the Republicans are great  or I think he may have said Donald Trump   But we werent talking about Donald Trump   We were talking about the left and right   Lets get beyond people   And he said  Because they are now nationalists   And the real problem is globalization and globalists   No  thats not the real problem And there are a lot of people right now that are being convinced that the argument is between nationalism and internationalism or globalism And you can look at it that way   Two people that did look at it that way were Stalin and Hitler   He was a nationalist  and Stalin was an internationalist   They both believed in giant government state control   One said  Were going to do this through the international community  and were going to lead the international community and anybody who gets in our way  were going to kill   And Hitler and Mussolini thought  Were going to do this for the good of our own nation because our nation is so great   And well just do that   And it will spread to other nations   And well bring it to those other nations  whether they like it or not Nationalism and internationalism is not our problem   Our problem is socialism  communism  or progressivism   That is the idea that is in direct conflict with the other idea of the Constitution A lot of people who were progressives dont like the idea that  that they would be labeled  along with socialists  not so much anymore  or communists   But socialism  if you know your history  your was only  Im sorry   Progressivism was only labeled that because they didnt agree with the one thing of  of  of communists   And that is  revolution Socialism is the step between capitalism and communism   And it lead to it If you dont believe me  read the words of Lenin before he got into office and they had the bloody revolution   He knew people were afraid of communists   And so he is the man  Lenin  that coined the term democratic socialist   Were not communists   Were democratic socialists   The people will vote   And theyll vote for socialism   And they did And then theyre free to say theyre communists   Now  this is  again  all earlier 20th century   But you have to know the roots of it   And Theodore Roosevelt was a nationalist and a socialist   Believed in big government progressivism   Woodrow Wilson was even more   And he was an internationalist   League of Nations   United Nations I contend we are having the argument that Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt were having 100 years ago   Is the national socialist better or the international socialist better The question has to be   Is the Constitution the answer   Because the Constitution will stop you from doing all kinds of things  like meddling in peoples lives  like telling them who they can and cannot marry or how they can and cannot run their business  unless its dangerous The Constitution stops the meddling in international affairs and stops globalism dead in its tracks   The Constitution is the reason we didnt have a set flag   We didnt  listen to me  we didnt have a set flag  I believe until Roosevelt   Theodore Roosevelt   It may have even been Wilson   You could arrange the stars any way you want   Why Because we wont so damn jingoistic   We believed in the concept of the flag  and it meant more than the flag itself   And it was Wilson  I believe  that went in and said  No  we have to nationalize everything and federalize   And now heres exactly how you treat the flag   It was Wilson that gave us that  who gave us the  the Star Spangled Banner   FDR   We are defending these things as if they came from the Founders  when the Founders themselves didnt establish a national anything They respected everyone to rule themselves under the Constitution   Now  progressives will always say  Well  the Declaration of Independence has nothing to do with the Constitution   You need to understand that the Declaration of Independence has everything to do with the Constitution Without the Declaration of Independence  the Constitution can be anything anyone wants For instance  let me give you an example because I know progressives hate the Declaration of Independence   They hate it   It has nothing to do with it It is something for that time and that time only   Why would they be against that   Why would they be against that Because the Declaration of Independence is what freed the slaves  not the Constitution   The Constitution gave the ability to free the slaves   But it was the Declaration of Independence that did free the slaves   Because the argument was  in our own documents  it says  All men are created equal That was the argument   So let me show you I want you to think about the Constitution   Because everybody says  Gods not in the Constitution   Its nowhere in the Constitution   Of course  its not The Constitution is nothing more than an engine   You know our Constitution is the most reused Constitution in the world   Our Declaration of Independence and our Constitution has been used by more countries than any other document to establish governance in the history of the world But wait a minute   All the countries are not like America   How come Because the Constitution is the combustion engine   Thats all it is   But I can make a truck  using that engine  and I can make a sports car using that engine What do you want the engine to do   Do you want it to just run some belts  to run a turbine  to put some lights on   Do you want to use it for an aircraft   Do you want to use it for a race car   Do you want to use it for a crane to help build buildings It is the framework   It is the principles  the framework that helps you do whatever it is you want to do The Bill of Rights  thats something separate   The Bill of Rights is something entirely different from the Constitution   What rights are in the Constitution   Well  actually none   Theyre found in the Bill of Rights  which is just as separate  came years  in fact  I think it was Connecticut  wasnt it  or one of the states that wasnt until 1939 that they ratified the Bill of Rights It came years later   Separate  yet part of it   And without the Bill of Rights  the Constitution doesnt work Well  it works   It will create all kinds of stuff   But it wont create things with rights So let me take you back to the first document   Because the first document tells you what were building   The Constitution tells you how to build it   The Declaration of Independence tells you what were building Theres seven things in just the opening two paragraphs of the Declaration of Independence that tell you everything you need to know about America One   The opening  can you read the opening line  when in the course of human events  Pat   It becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands that have tied themselves to another people PAT   That have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth  the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of natures God entitle them GLENN   Okay   What does that mean   Separate  but equal station   Theyre going to assume  what theyre saying is  there comes a time  if were going to disband ourselves from a government  a king  somebody else thats ruling over us  we  its  the only right thing to do is to state why   Why are we doing this We need to tell the world  and we need to really remind ourselves why were doing this   And assume the separate  but equal stations So theyre saying  Were not better than the king of England   But hes not better than we are   It immediately establishes humility for our nation   Were not better than everyone else   Our Declaration of Independence says the separate  but equal station   Nobody is the boss of us   And were not the boss of you But theres a more important thing that I havent addressed in that line   And that is this   The separate  but equal station  which the laws of nature and natures God entitle them   Well come back to that Then the next paragraph is  this is why  this is why were breaking away from the king   Okay   Because  listen   We think that things are pretty clear   Let me state it this way   We hold these truths to be self evident   We think everybody knows this   But nobody has ever said it before  let alone write it down    We hold these truths to be self evident  that all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights   And that among these are life  liberty  and Im going to use the original word  property   Why would I use that   Because pursuit of happiness  replace the word property  because they felt if they put property in there  then the left  or  Im sorry  then the South would say  Well  its in the Declaration of Independence   We have a right to property  and slaves are our property    And then we would have had the argument  are they property  or are they men   And that would have slowed everything down   So dont give them the tool of saying that theyre property So they changed it to something enigmatic   The pursuit of happiness   Meaning  your right to go and be your own businessperson and do what you feel and follow your spirit and go paint a cloud Life  liberty  and property   Heres another important part   That to secure these rights  governments are instituted among men   The government derives its powers from the consent of the governed   And that whenever any form of government becomes destructive to those ends  which ends   Destructive of which ends It is the right of the people to alter or abolish it   Now  let me go back They have certain unalienable rights  meaning God gave them these rights  and nobody can change them   Unalienable or inalienable   Whichever word you choose to use is  it means you cannot change them   No one can change them   They are universal   They are  they are the laws of nature and natures God What does nature and natures God mean Lets use the Second Amendment   Thats not a law of God   Where in the Bible does it say you have a right to have guns  you have a right to protect yourself I guess you could read it through that  but its really clear in the laws of nature In fact  you could use the laws of God to say  Well  maybe you dont because he says thou shall not murder  and you can use a gun to murder   So they want to be very specific The laws of nature   Thats the first one   Can you find that right in nature   Yeah   Nobody is going to say to me  but theyll say it about humans all the time    Nobody is going to say  if I walk into a cave with a bear and I just want to go hug the little baby bear and the bear mom kills me  nowhere  nowhere in the press are they going to say  Oh  my gosh  we should destroy that bear   That bear is evil   We should declaw all bears    Theyll say  That stupid guy went into a cave  and the bear  the mama bear thought he was threatening the children   Of course  she tore him apart   Thats the Second Amendment   Natures law gives you the right to self protect and to protect your family and your home Featured Image  The exterior of the National Constitution Center displays the opening words of the United States

Heres a no brainer  The Walking Dead is a fictional TV show  Therefore  when discussing the much anticipated season 7 premiere  one should keep in mind that its not real  Repeat  The Walking Dead is not real There is no government  There is no authority  There is no law  Theres only chaos  And theres only these walkers and then bad people trying to kill less bad  people  Co host Pat Gray said Monday on The Glenn Beck Program Co host Jeffy concurred Groups of people trying to survive with each other  he said Pat went on to marvel at people hanging on to their humanity in that type of situation Guys  you realize this isnt a documentary  you realize that  Co host Stu Burguiere bravely asked Read below or listen to the full segment for answers to these battered questions  What does Pat consider the greatest TV show before The Walking Dead  Is The Walking Dead torture porn  How did 24 turn into a commercial for CAIR and global warming  Why would Pat become violent with Jeffy  Is there a new standard in TV violence Listen to this segment  beginning at mark 38 28  from The Glenn Beck Program Below is a rush transcript of this segment  it might contain errors The Walking Dead premiered season seven  is it  Jeffy JEFFY   Yes  it did PAT   Season seven  last night   And well start there  right now music PAT   Id have to say The Walking Dead is one of the best television shows of all time   Would you agree with that JEFFY   I would   I would agree with you   Yeah PAT   I mean  I  24  up until now  up until recently  24 was probably the TV show that I thought was maybe the greatest of all time JEFFY   For you PAT   Every week was like movie quality programming  during the best years of 24   And then at the end  it was like  Shut up   It was a commercial for CAIR toward the end and global warming STU   And global warming PAT   Oh  it was agonizing STU   Its funny   Now youre seeing like a pushback against that   What was that movie   It was an English movie  a bunch of English guys  and they were kind of like in their own little FBI  Secret Service   The  oh  God   The Kingsman   The Kingsman   Anyone see the Kingsman    The villain in that movie was a guy  it was Samuel L  Jackson  who his belief was man was killing the environment so much  he had to wipe out most of humanity   And so he was starting out this like doomsday level event to call all these people   The new movie with Tom Hanks coming out which is from the Da Vinci Code JEFFY   Oh  yeah  yeah STU   Seemingly from the previews  PAT   Its called Inferno JEFFY   Thats what it is   Right   Yeah STU   Inferno   The Inferno virus is something created by a crazy environmentalist who believes he has to wipe out most of the worlds population because the earth is destroying it PAT   Wow STU   I mean  two from Hollywood PAT   Good STU   Kind of incredible to see that PAT   It is STU   Yeah  but you go back to the 24 days  that was a big thing   They break to say  by the way  we want  sure  we shot and tortured a bunch of Muslim terrorists PAT   We didnt mean to   And dont ever think that any Muslim is ever responsible for any terrorism because that just cant happen   That cant happen JEFFY   Ever STU   This is fiction   And you shouldnt go beat up your local Muslim because we know you people   We know what youre like PAT   Thanks  Keeper   None of us could figure that out on our own STU   Exactly   And then global warming  I dont even know how that one was thrown in there   Look  if youre going to kill a bunch of terrorists  youre going to emit some CO2   And thats why  that was just a bizarre tie in   But I think it was one of the costs of liberals participating in a conservative show   Its like Kiefer  phonetic   Come on  do the show   Its a great show   Its about struggling against terrorism   Look  Im not comfortable about that material   If I can do a message about global warming though  a serious message in the break and just say  Guys  I know  this is all fun and games   This whole terrorism thing  its not real   But you know what is real   Invisible gas  changing your world   That is  you needed to have that in there to get them to play along PAT   They did   And they deny it   I mean  we talked to Joel  inaudible  that one time   Had a get together   And I asked him if  you know  he was forced   And he didnt think that they were doing anything out of the ordinary JEFFY   Right PAT   And I dont know if he just  if that was just the line he had to sell to feel better about it STU   Well  I think  PAT   But it was pretty clear they had caved at the end STU   I think too  theres an instance of youre trying to be surprising  right   The thing with 24  there was always unexpected twists and turns   And you could say that  okay   The Muslim  because theres always a low level Muslim terrorist involved in every 24 plot   At the very lowest level  theres a Muslim terrorist   Theres an Islamic extremist involved PAT   Yeah  but its usually the president or vice president of the United States thats really behind it STU   Right   Who is really behind it  its always like a Croatian   Okay PAT   A Croatian  but with help from the US government   You got to get that help from the US government STU   Always   Its always an inside job PAT   Always   There was a French guy one year   There was a Croatian   There was a French guy   I dont know which   And then there was some Frenchy guy in there STU   Oh  yeah   Yeah PAT   It was always  STU   Nazis   Theres the one Nazi who  PAT   South African   South Africans are popular STU   Yeah PAT   You can make fun of them all day because of apartheid STU   So The Walking Dead doesnt do this   All the walkers are not Republicans or anything like that PAT   Actually  we dont to have deal pretty much with any politics like that STU   Youre just beating the crap out of zombies PAT   Yeah   And live people JEFFY   Yeah  this year  PAT   Really  its kind of morphed into  the zombies are sort of secondary now STU   Yeah PAT   Its really the live people you have to worry about JEFFY   And  first of all  we dont call them zombies STU   Theyre walkers   I know   But if you dont watch the show  you might not understand them PAT   Hardly anybody doesnt watch the show  its the number one show on TV JEFFY   Yeah  Ill be fascinated to see the ratings from last night PAT   Yeah  it will be interesting JEFFY   What they were   Because I was just reading  season six  last season  they were 48 percent higher than the top show on broadcast TV  season six  their ratings   18 49 PAT   Wow   Wow JEFFY   Thats pretty impressive PAT   Its on AMC   Think of that JEFFY   I know PAT   I mean  there was a time five years ago we didnt think that was possible   There will never be a cable show that would beat network television   That just wont happen STU   Its not even close PAT   Its not even close   And now  because of The Walking Dead and other shows  Breaking Bad broke a lot of ground and created a lot of buzz   And then that kind of built up for The Walking Dead   And now  look at where that is   The by far the number one show on TV   By far   So it will be interesting to see how well  JEFFY   I want to talk about it really bad   And youre going to not want me to talk about the episode  PAT   Well  they were saying there was a lot of violence  right JEFFY   There was quite a bit of violence PAT   A lot of violence JEFFY   With  and there was quite a bit of violence done by Lucille  the bat    PAT   If you divulge one thing  because I havent seen it yet  if you divulge  if you wreck this for me  the violence on that show will be nothing compared to the violence Im going to reign down on you today   Dont even do it   Dont even do it STU   Well  I think it was Dana Loesch who is on TheBlaze as well  tweeted something to the effect of that its essentially  we  its torture porn   Like  were to the point where now  were getting to torture porn in this show JEFFY   Well   PAT   That was one of the knocks on it   We read an article last week  about the decline or something of The Walking Dead   And their deal was  it started out as kind of charming violence or gore   And now its become something  its morphed into something more than that JEFFY   Yeah   And they were  in that article  he was talking about how he wanted the survivors to evolve   And he was saying the survivors havent evolved enough   In the article  he mentioned Carol   But really  when you  I think all the characters have evolved  quite a lot PAT   Oh  yeah   They have JEFFY   Theyve done the best they can to hold on to their humanity   I mean  thats what makes the show so good   Right PAT   Right JEFFY   And were at a point now where  PAT   And you see that struggle all along  to hang on to some remnant of humanity JEFFY   Right   Right   I mean  thats what makes them different than the people they run into PAT   Because if you know about what the show is about  were at seven years now into this apocalypse  where every  society has completely broken down JEFFY   Yeah PAT   There is no government   There is no authority   There is no law   Theres only chaos   And theres only these walkers and then bad people trying to kill less bad  JEFFY   Groups of people trying to survive with each other PAT   Yes   And theyre trying to set up some form of hierarchy so that there can be some order among the chaos   And for anybody to hang onto humanity in that situation  its pretty amazing   Pretty amazing JEFFY   Yeah   And this show shows you obviously how difficult it is with all the obvious around them STU   Guys  you realize this isnt a documentary  you realize that JEFFY   For instance  what happened last night  Stu PAT   So youre not going to tell us what happened last night STU   The Economist did an article about guns and how they get into films   And its largely about how basically  you know  gun manufacturers  like how specific guns get into films  they become popular and their sales go up   You know  just like product placement for anything JEFFY   Sure STU   But theres one little nugget in there that I thought was pretty interesting   Researchers have found that gun violence in PG 13 films  and this doesnt necessarily go to all violence  but this is just specifically gun violence   In recent years has  has tripled since 1985 and has even exceeded the violence in R rated films PAT   Wow STU   And were seeing this  Walking Dead is an example of this  where its become so violent   Theres some scenes in Breaking Bad is another one   Is so incredibly violent and disturbing   And its going further and further and further on that   And its a weird line   Because for some reason  thats much more okay than  than the oversexualized stuff and even the language PAT   And thats explainable STU   I think it is   I think it is PAT   Youre much less likely to go out and murder somebody after youve seen violence than you are to go out and have sex with somebody once youve been stimulated in that way  right STU   Yeah  I think  well  I look at it a little bit differently than that JEFFY   I dont know PAT   Oh  come on   Its a no brainer STU   The difference between it is  morally speaking  for a second  morally  because I dont think that stuff  I dont necessarily think that  you know  it can   Obviously  like  you know  certain  opening yourself to certain things that you watch can influence your behavior   Its certainly been shown in studies    But I think like  more than that is  morally speaking  I have no desire to go out and  you know  torture a zombie or a walker for the next 45 hours   I have no  maybe I would if I was in that situation   But theres no  like  inherent desire for me to commit violence against another person   Obviously there is inside of most of us  there is a sexual desire that you like PAT   Right STU   So  you want to see women naked   You dont necessarily want to see  I have no  Im rooting for the person to avoid the violence in most of these movies   You want the person to get away   To escape   Thats different motivation  I guess  when it comes to the nudity and such But  again  even  even language  I mean  Jeffy  ever since Ive known Jeffy  JEFFY   Language STU    one of the first things he said out of his mouth when we were doing radio is  Im not the word police  when someone was swearing on the air   Im not the word police    Jeffy  youre supposed to press the dump button  JEFFY   Im not the word police STU   Im not the word police   That was the big Jeffy thing   Ever since Ive known him  hes said that    But you think about it  we really do monitor language much more than we monitor violence JEFFY   Yes  we do STU   Its a shocking thing   I mean  if someone comes on the air and swears here  were going to dump your words   But  I mean  there would be huge consequences if we didnt   You know  the FCC would be all over that   We could go on and on and on about extreme violence   And in some cases  to make points about war and terrorism and things like that  we have   Weve talked to you about people being beheaded on the border and all of that   The crime that goes on there   You know  you could do that all day   But if you say a word that is a little bit salty  you know  the whole world collapses   It is a weird standard JEFFY   Oh  my gosh   I know STU   I do think that is a strange standard   And we all kind of accept the violence thing   And sometimes it is  it can be really disturbing   I mean  stuff that was in Saw  you can now see  JEFFY   It was there for the violence   That was the whole point of those movies  right   Was to just see how bad you could torture people STU   I think it was the problem solving Jeffy    JEFFY   Oh    STU   How do  it was more of an IQ test JEFFY   Youre right   Youre right   How to get out of it   I apologize   Youre right   Youre right STU   But  I mean  a lot of that stuff  certainly on HBO  for sure   But even on AMC  you know  a scene in Breaking Bad comes to mind  where they needed to get rid of a body  and they put it in a bathtub with acid and stuff like that   It was really disturbing PAT   And theres some disturbing scenes in in The Walking Dead   I mean  seriously disturbing   Things you thought you could never see on TV are right there for you STU   And its the number one show on television   JEFFY   I know    STU   Remember how they used to say  well  like family hour   When you have shows that are aimed at a large audience  you dont put those things in there   I mean  this is  while its not aimed at family hour  by any means  its still a show thats the number one show on television   And  I mean  its probably the top three or four most violent shows on television PAT   Oh  yeah   By far STU   The stuff  they talk  I listen to it   I cannot even discuss it on the air   I just went on this whole thing about how we cant say certain things on the air   I cannot even discuss on this show what was discussed on a recent episode of Law   Order SVU that I watched   I cannot believe that show airs JEFFY   Ill tell you  Criminal Minds does the same thing   Criminal Minds from time to time goes really deep into stuff we cant talk about STU   Its insanity   I mean  the fact there is a show that runs every week that is highly rated that every week  as a requirement of the episode  is a detailed description of a brutal rape  JEFFY   Yeah STU   Thats the premise of the show  is that theyre going to describe how a woman was brutally raped and left on some sidewalk somewhere   And  of course  its a  its one of those shows where youre looking for sort of forensic information and everything   So they always  as a requirement of the show  go into extreme detail about how the crime was committed   What fluid was left where   What  what it  I mean  what the medical reports say   And its insanity   I want  I was a  I was in a hospital for  I had a relative who was in the hospital   And they  you know  of course  as I think every day they run a non stop marathon on like TBS or something   And that was the channel was on   So I was in the waiting room for hours and hours and hours   And it was episode after episode after episode of freaking Law   Order SVU   And  you know  I had watched the show a couple times  but never really put it together   These people have put together hundreds of rape story lines JEFFY   Oh  yeah STU   And its on normal TV every single week JEFFY   And they put together fake rape story lines   And real rape story lines STU   Yeah JEFFY   And story lines that much  the top story of the news STU   Oh  yeah   They like that JEFFY   And old rape story lines   I mean  its amazing STU   Its incredible   The stuff that is discussed on just mainstream television   They always like to say  Oh  conservatives  theyre always trying to control the culture   If we are  we suck at it   I mean  we are terrible at that   I mean  the lines that get blown by every single day on television now  its incredible PAT   Its unbelievable   Yeah  were past Leave It To Beaver land JEFFY   Oh  my gosh  yes   There was a scene last night in Walking Dead  PAT   Gee  Wally  it wouldnt be real neat o if you told me what happened last night   Ill crush your skull JEFFY   There was a scene last night PAT   It wouldnt be real neat o to tell me STU   Come on   Lets just get a quick update from Jeffy of exactly what happened PAT   Just overall  was it a great episode JEFFY   I enjoyed it  yes PAT   Yeah   Okay   877 727 BECK   More of the Glenn Beck Program   Coming up OUT AT 9 23AM PAT   What do you think about this mega merger with AT T  BellSouth  TimeWarner  Turner TBS  CNN  Warner Brothers  DirecTV  all under the same umbrella   All the same company   Wow STU   Yeah PAT   I mean  you want the free market to be free  but then you also think  well  isnt that like a monopoly   Dont we have  STU   Yeah   That standard should be super high for that PAT   But  I mean  STU   If youre going to get the  PAT   Youre getting pretty out of control with a company like that STU   Why   To do what   The worry is  they might restrict  I mean  its the same net neutrality arguments that get made over and over again   They might restrict people from watching Game of Thrones  because if youre not AT T or DirecTV PAT   Uh huh STU   Well  first of all  theyre not going to do that in their own interests   Second of all  should the government get involved because  if they did this  should the government get involved because Game of Thrones cant be watched by anyone else   Lets just say they want to a ridiculous level they never would   You cant purchase it   You cant watch it   We wont stream it to you if youre on a competitor    If you have Comcast  you cannot see the show from HBO    And   Like is that where the government is supposed to step in and get involved PAT   Just worry about competition   I worry about  I mean  this is almost everybody   I mean  this is  STU   But  again  weve been hearing these warnings for how long   And its like  have our entertainment options  have they increased or decreased   Weve got the number one show on television thats on AMC PAT   Yeah   I know STU   I mean  we have  this  this world  again  were at a point where the shows that everybody is talking about are on a network thats not even a network   Netflix  we talked about this last week on Pat   Stu  which by the way  airs on TheBlaze every single day   And this was a situation where its Netflix thats spending more than anyone else on original programming   Netflix    This is  you know  I mean  we have more options now than weve ever had before   More high quality television than weve ever had before   These are  these are the golden years of television right now   I mean  you can go to channels you didnt even know existed five years ago and watch shows that are better than anything that was on television PAT   Its nerve racking because just 15 months ago  AT T acquired DirecTV   Now if they acquire TimeWarner  that gives it HBO  CNN  TBS  TNT  Cartoon Network  and Warner Brothers   Thats a  thats a pretty massive company STU   Yeah PAT   Yeah Featured Image  Photos from Twitter The Walking Dead  WalkingDead AMC   ,0

Editors Note  The following is based on Glenns monologue from August 23  2016 I want to have a really open and frank discussion with you  because we are tearing each other apart Maybe some of it is justified  and maybe I played a role in dividing us  I am human  Im a guy who tries to be better every day  but oftentimes fails   The things being said about me right now dont matter to me  And I want to save you a lot of time  If youre one of those people thinking that Im going to change my mind or that youre going to scare me into shutting up  Im not that guy   After a year of looking at this race  and beyond that the last 15 years of studying revolutions  studying how things happen  studying history  I expected a revolution to come from the left  I have laid out how revolutions happen over and over and over again  So Im looking at things differently than just today  Im looking at things historically and over the horizon  taking into account things that  maybe  others dont Now  you may disagree with everything Im about to say  and thats fine  But I want you to understand where Im coming from  I dont expect you to change your mind  In fact  Im not trying to change your mind  I just want you to know why Im doing what I feel I must do I Am Not Voting for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump First of all  I dont hold anything against anyone who votes differently than me  Because  honestly  Im not happy with how Im going to vote  For the first time in my life  I am not going to vote for one of the two major candidates  I am not voting for Hillary Clinton  and I am not voting for Donald Trump  I dont know how Im going to vote for president yet  but those two are not on the table Secondly  I see a lot of people saying  I was a fan of Glenn Beck until he sold out  If you have listened to me and appreciated the show  what am I selling out  If you are a fan of this show  its most likely because Ive said what I believe  Many times  Ive said what you believe  I have also said many things that no one believes  I dont pull any punches  and Im the last guy to sell out You have always listened because I tell you what I believe is happening and what is coming  Many times  I have been wrong  But  many times  I have been right  And when Im right  it is devastating    A Pattern of Predictions If youre a fan of this show  you know Ive had a pattern of making correct predictions Osama bin Laden In 1999  I was defending Bill Clintons bombing of the aspirin factory because I started doing my homework on Osama bin Laden  At this point  only the intelligence community knew about Osama bin Laden  I got on the air  reading his words and warning about him  Callers said  Youre just trying to excuse this to help the Democrats win in 2000  Youre just trying to cover up for Bill Clinton and take his name off the front pages with Monica Lewinsky  In a moment of frustration  I said  There will be blood  bodies and buildings in the streets of New York  and it will have been done by Osama bin Laden  Will you be willing to admit that terror is coming at that point Iraq When I said something was wrong in Iraq  beginning in 2003 or 2004  I said we werent fighting this to win  My audience said  Youre only trying to help the Democrats  I got a lot of complaints from a lot of stations  and a lot of people were very angry with me Economic Collapse When I warned about a market collapse and a housing bubble in 2006  I was told even by some of my best friends  You cant say this about the Republicans and what George Bush is doing  Youll kill yourself  In the fall of 2007  I said  Dont listen to John McCain right now and all of the pundits who are saying that hes going to be strong on the war in Iraq  I said  Come next fall  the economy will be all that people are talking about  Forget the war  Its going to be the economy  People said I was crazy  I was drinking  I had sold out  And  of course  I was only trying to help the Democrats get Barack Obama elected The Caliphate When I warned about the caliphate  I was told every single day to shut up  I was told by Fox  Shut up  Stop talking about that  and stop talking about Israel  Every single day  To the point where they came and took things off my set to get me to stop talking about it  I talked about it every day until it was my last  They said it made me look crazy  I said  So be it    The Strongman Cometh There is a reason  a real reason  my family and I have 24 hour security  I have said from the day my security team started  I am more worried about a crazy person on the right who thinks I have betrayed them than somebody on the left   One controversy that everybody seems to have forgotten was what the Anti Defamation League  ADL  did  what Fox News did  It was in all of the magazines at the time  It was all over the internet  Jon Stewart made fun of it  Stephen Colbert made fun of it  They always made fun of me talking about the Nazis  right  Glenn Beck is talking about the Nazis   The ADL told Fox News to tell me to stop talking about the word Nazis  I argued  How can you not forget if you dont remember  I continued talking about the Nazis and the Nazi threat  Heres what people missed in that  What I was talking about was that a strongman could come from the right or the left  I said specifically  The right is already doing it in Europe  and if we forget that we are not Europe  the right will rise here and a strongman will come to the forefront  if  and only if  the left can wear us out  the left can make us feel beaten and that there is no other way out  and if the left continues to push the pendulum further and further left  You remember the pendulum show  That was the complaint from the ADL    That is why I was talking about Nazis  because I predicted the rise of the Nazis  And later  Golden Dawn came and the far right in Spain  the far right in Germany  the far right in Austria  the far right now in France  Its happening  But it is also happening here  and you see it  We are farther behind  but the alt right  the fascists and the white supremacists are on the rise  David Duke is running for Senate History shows us that a strongman always will and always does rise  Someone at the point of chaos that says  I will restore order  Do you remember me warning about top down  bottom up and inside out  What are people saying right now  What is Donald Trump saying  What was the point of his entire convention  I will restore order  I am Mr  Law And Order  I will do it  and I am the only one who can do it What are people shouting for right now  What are your friends who are supporting him saying  They want somebody who will just take control and burn the system down  Thats insanity I ask that you hear my words today  Ive warned about top down  bottom up and inside out  I believe that this is that moment  It is coming on the horizon very soon  and youre seeing the beginning of it right now Donald Trump I believe that Donald Trump is the strongman that I did not think would come from the right  but the pendulum has swung back so far  That does not make him a Nazi or his supporters a Nazi  although some of his supporters are literal Nazis  The vast majority are not It does mean that I think he has the potential to be  at least  a South American strongman in the right conditions   So what are the right conditions    1  No connection to the Founding and our Constitution 2  Global war 3  Domestic uprisings 4  Terror 5  Real economic hardship When those conditions are met and the man in the oval office demands that its my way or the highway  if that man is a bully and surrounds himself with like minded bullies  if he has a historic pull towards a socialistic solution like nationalizing banks  huge bailouts and protectionism then the cause of concern should be our loudest discussion  but it is not Steve Bannon  Donald Trumps new campaign CEO  told Slate magazine that he is not a nationalist  nor a populist  He called himself a Leninist  Thats not John Lennon  thats Vladimir Lenin  The reporter was so shocked  he said  Explain that to me  And Bannon said  Lenin wanted to destroy the state  and thats my goal too  I want to bring everything crashing down and destroy all of todays establishment  He included the Republican and Democrat parties  as well as the traditional conservative press Historically  you need chaos to have a strongman come into power  And a strongman always has certain attributes  He doesnt believe in things like individual rights and the Constitution  Generally  they are socialistic in their tendencies  that what is right for the individual doesnt matter  Hes also somebody who demands his way  hes a bully  He surrounds himself with like minded bullies  and usually the people he surrounds himself with are even worse than he is  And if those things are met  along with the conditions of war  domestic uprisings  terror and real economic hardship  a country  any country  is in real trouble  This is what we should be talking about right now  What does the world look like in four years after either one of these two   People write to me  People call me  People have approached me in church  everywhere  saying  Glenn  Glenn  I cant listen to you anymore  I understand  I really do  I wish that werent true  I wish I had enough credibility over a 16  17 year history with you  that you saw that  yes  I have pissed you off in the past and I have said things that you really didnt want to hear  but in the end  you were glad you heard them  You were glad you had a warning I dont know what else to do  I dont know what you want me to do  I can only do what I feel Im supposed to do  what I feel the Lord has commanded me to do  and that is  tell the truth  I dont think the Lord is commanding me to expose Donald Trump  Im not saying that  Im saying he has commanded me to do my own homework  He has commanded me to never compromise on what I truly believe  So Im kind of stuck   Im really stuck because there is a warning in Ezekiel  that in those days there will be a watchman on the tower  at the gates  And that means all of us in our own way are watchmen on the gates  in your own life  And if you see trouble coming  youre supposed to warn the people  If you dont  the blood of everyone who could have heard the warning and could have done something  that blood is on our hands as the watchmen  If the people inside the gates decide not to listen to the watchmen  thats fine  thats up to them  But I have a responsibility to tell you  This is what my job is  as I see it Some people see their job as to make money  get advertisements  get ratings  et cetera  et cetera  Ive never believed in somebody who is on the air  read my first book  who is into a cause  Unfortunately  I found God  And I have changed that opinion that I have to do what is right  Im not just an entertainer Hillary Clinton I beg anyone with eyes and ears to look and listen  Please dont make this about Clinton  Im not voting for Clinton  I never will vote for Clinton  And I know who she is  I have railed about her for over 20 years  I know who she is Im the one who exposed her running guns in Benghazi while she was still telling everybody in the press about the film  Im very aware of who she is  I know how dangerous she is  I know what she believes  But dont let how dangerous she is or the false binary choice of our elections blind you to the other side of the equation If she wins  yes  we are going to be crippled with an outrageous Supreme Court where maybe Barack Obama is a Supreme Court justice  Thats a real possibility with her  It is horrible the future under her  Perhaps it is worse than even you believe under her  I see the grave potential of an international globalist structure  because thats what an early 20th century progressive  as she describes herself and as outlined in my book Liars  thats what they wanted   United Nations  the League of Nations  or something like that  And we are headed to it But I would rather fight a globalist structure than fight each other internally  I dont know how we get through it  But I do know this   We survive if we hold on to each other  We survive  Many of us didnt think wed make it this far with Barack Obama  but we survived  Horribly  but we survived Our Dunkirk Moment Winston Churchill found himself with Dunkirk  Everybody said  If you pull the army back  we lose all of Europe  He said  If I dont pull them across the channel  we lose everything  We lose the entire army Well  if you pull them out  were never going to get it back He said  Save what little you have to fight another day  This is lost This is our Dunkirk moment  If Im right about Donald Trump  it will take a coup or a revolution to restore freedom to America    The world is heading towards global war  Economic collapse is a near certainty  Domestic uprising is already happening and will continue to grow  as anger and hate on both sides is being fueled by those who are in control  And we all know how domestic terror isnt coming  Domestic terror is already here    I warned of this very thing  I have told you  at the time  most of us would not see it  Its why I asked you to prepare spiritually  It is why I  even at Restoring Honor  I begged you  Dont bring signs  Dont chant  Dont do any of those things  Its why in Birmingham  I said  Weve got to keep the structure of Martin Luther King Why  Glenn I dont know  other than  I know it seems ridiculous now  but at some point  this audience is going need to have the discipline of standing alone and being beaten  I said We are here  And Ive always believed that this audience is the only hope because you are the only audience that has truly been prepared for these things at this time  You have more information than most do because you have been with me and you have heard the warnings  you have seen it coming  you have learned history  Youre not easily duped You are not who they say you are  Ive said to you over the last ten years  If you stay strong  if you dont get swept up in the anger or the cries of payback or the cry for somebody to just make it stop  you will be our Republics last line of defense So what do I do  People are telling me  At least just shut up  I cant  I cant You condemn me if I continue to warn  but God condemns me if I fail to warn   24601   Who am I   Jean Valjean made exactly the same choice as I am  except in the play  it ends happy for him   Life is much more like the book  not the play If Im wrong  I am the biggest fool  and I have been discredited   And I will be the first to apologize  and I will apologize if I have any listeners left at that time   But if I dont have any listeners left at that time  I make that as a fair trade for my credibility and my integrity    As a guy who has lost everything  all I ever wanted was my integrity back   My integrity has been under attack over the last two years like nobodys business   It is the only thing I have of value  and I will do nothing knowingly myself to damage it   Integrity always comes with the highest of prices   Its why most are unwilling to ever pay for it I dont ask you to believe   I ask you to do what youve always done  and what Ive always asked you to do Dont believe me  Do your own homework  Study how revolutions happen  Study what it means and who has said in the past  I just want to burn the whole system down   I just want to smash the entire system  Ask what happens in times of trouble and in a country as divided as we are  when somebody comes in  who is an egomaniacal kind of guy and surrounds himself with that    Im not asking to you believe me   Im asking you to do your homework and to just remember that old T shirt somebody printed a long time ago that asked this question   What if this time  what if Glenn Beck is right Listen to this segment from The Glenn Beck Program Featured Image  Screenshot of The Glenn

Still on the road in sunny California  Glenn had the opportunity yesterday afternoon to speak with a few hundred young liberals  While most would not have normally crossed the street to meet him  they were very attentive  civil  and there may have been a breakthrough   RELATED  Young People Who Get It Are the Greatest Beacon of Hope in America Were in this unbelievable screening room  It looked like one of the nicest theaters Ive ever been in  but it was a screening room  and I walk in the back door onto the little stage area  looking at this  Im  like  wow are you guys living in a bubble  This is sweet  And I sit down  and they start asking questions  Glenn said   One line of questioning was very telling There is disenfranchisement on both sides  And it was really interesting because several of the questions revolved around this  One of them clearly stated this  and the other ones were kind of hinting around this  What happens if I cant pull the lever for Hillary Clinton  Does that mean Im responsible for electing Donald Trump The irony wasnt lost on Glenn I just  I mean  I wanted to laugh  Im  like  boy  Ive heard this conversation before  except its on the other side  Glenn said   One thing struck Glenn during his time with the group  There is a unique opportunity to have a real  issues based conversation We talked about gun control  we talked about abortion  we talked about everything  and we did it peacefully  respectfully  quietly  It was a fascinating  Glenn said  They were all sitting on the edge of their seats  and they were really  truly trying to listen and understand Glenns common sense perspective seemed to resonate and  perhaps  break down some barriers  or at the very least  allow people to consider things from a different angle   On the issue of gun control  Glenn explained why the only way to change the stance on guns is through a constitutional amendment  When one audience member suggested laws to curtail and control gun usage  Glenn detailed why that would never sit well with conservatives or solve whats perceived to be the problem You have to have a constitutional amendment  If you can get a constitutional amendment fairly  squarely  then maybe you would have a chance of solving it  But you have to do it the right way because its in  the Constitution  I warn you  like prohibition  you might be able to get it through  but it will reverse itself quickly  Glenn said On the issue of abortion  Glenn explained why those on the side of life cannot compromise  comparing a life in the womb to a life in a Jewish concentration camp We cant compromise because those of us who believe in life believe that it is a human life  So its the weakest among us  and we have to stand  Glenn said While we may disagree on specific issues  if we stop trying to control each others lives  those issues  for the most part  become irrelevant When it comes to bathrooms and gay marriage  we can argue back and forth  but the argument means nothing if you having gay marriage doesnt affect in any way my marriage or my faith or my church  Glenn said  If I dont have to perform gay marriage  if I dont have to bake a wedding cake  if my faith says you cant get involved in that  you cant force me  Just like I cant force you not to get into marriage   Glenn explained one aspect of marriage which he said had scales falling off of their eyes  He asked if anyone knew why we even have marriage licenses  nobody raised their hand    We have a marriage license because Progressives wanted to make sure blacks and whites never mixed races  We have a blood test to keep the undesirables from breeding  Thats all nonsense  Thats all eugenics  So why are we arguing over marriage licenses  Glenn asked Many seemed to really understand what Glenn was trying to say  Stop arguing nonsense and stick to your principles Listen to this segment from The Glenn Beck Program Featured Image  The freshly painted Hollywood Sign is seen after a press conference to announce the completion of the famous landmarks major makeover  December 4  2012 in Hollywood  California  Some 360 gallons  around 1 360 liters  of paint and primer were used to provide the iconic sign with it most extensive refurbishment in almost 35 years in advance of its 90th birthday next year  AFP PHOTO   Robyn Beck  Photo credit should read ROBYN BECK AFP Getty Images   ,0

Ted Cruz joined The Glenn Beck Program as a guest on Monday  On the issue of gun control  Senator Cruz addressed President Obamas abuse of office  using the power of executive order to circumvent Congress Well  Im sorry to say no one is surprised by this latest action by President Obama  said Senator Cruz  He has spent seven years abusing his constitutional authority  abusing his executive power  And this has been the most anti gun  most anti Second Amendment administration in history Senator Cruz went on to say how Eric Holder  the previous attorney general  believed it was his job was to brainwash Americans against guns   The senator also offered a silver lining to correct this abusive precedent President Obama has used executive power over and over again to abuse his authority  and everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power  And I have pledged on the very first day of my presidency to rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action by Barack Obama  Cruz promised Listen to this segment below  beginning around 4 25 Below is a rush transcript of this segment  it might contain errors GLENN   Okay  So let me go next to the president and hisand his new idea onon guns  that range anywhere from making sure that that the government can take their own sweet time on background checks  to now circumventing HIPAA  it seems  if theres somebody in your family that has some sort of mental disorder or whatever that the doctors now have to alert the government that those guns might be in dangerous proximity TED   Well  Im sorry to say no one is surprised by this latest action by President Obama  He has spent seven years abusing his constitutional authority  abusing his executive power  And this has been the most anti gun  most anti Second Amendment administration in history  We have a president who has done everything he could to restrict our rights to keep and bear arms  The previous attorney general  Eric Holder  said he believed his job was to brainwash Americans against guns  And I fully expect when we see all the details of what he does  that this will be yet another abuse of power    But there is a silver lining  Glenn  President Obama has used executive power over and over again to abuse his authority  and everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power  And I have pledged on the very first day of my presidency to rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action by Barack Obama GLENN   So that led me to this question earlier today  Because I made that point that I cant guess theyou know  I think Hillary Clinton would leave them in  I cant guess what Donald Trump has done  Because hes been on both sides of the issue on gun control  However  you I am very clear on what you would do  So that led me to the question  If Barack Obama knows that he only has  you know  11 months left  and unless its Hillary Clinton coming in  why  why would he do this  Because he knows that if its a Republican  its going to be undone   TED   Well  I think hes betting on two things  Number one  I think it is in his nature to abuse his power right up until the very minute he leaves the Oval Office  I think this is a man who believes in government power  And I think he has an admission hes a true believer  The violation of our Bill of Rights for the last several years has been concerted  Its been organized  And it will continue sadly right up until noon on January 20th  2017    But I think secondly  Barack Obama is betting that Republicans will do what weve done in the past  which is nominate a candidate that is not willing to run as a strong conservative  that is not willing to paint in bold colors  that will be cowed by the mainstream media and the Washington cartel  And I think theyre betting the next Republican president wouldnt have the courage to rescind these orders    I can tell you right now  in my view  these orders are not worth the paper theyre printed on because theyre going away within the first hours after Im sworn into office on January 20 Featured Image  Screenshot from The Glenn Beck Program ,0
On radio Monday morning  Senator Rand Paul accused President Obama of trying to bait and switch the American people to focus on gun control rather than the real issues threatening our country In a speech Sunday night from the Oval Office  the president said the U S  was doing everything possible to stop ISIS and proposed taking away guns from anyone on a no fly list  To help illustrate how ludicrous this plan would be  Paul suggested an analogy What if we had a no fly list and we were going to take away First Amendment rights from certain journalists  Paul asked  I think journalists would want some kind of court proceeding before they had their First Amendment taken away  It should be the same for the Second Amendment He continued Im all for taking away guns of terrorists  In fact  I dont want to let them enter our country to begin with  he said Pat then asked what Pauls strategy would be for defeating ISIS if he were to become president  Watch his response Listen to the full segment or read the transcript below Below is a rush transcript of this segment  it might contain errors PAT   Senator and US presidential hopeful Rand Paul joining us right now   Senator Paul  welcome to the Glenn Beck Program RAND   Good morning  guys   Thanks for having me PAT   Thanks for being here   How impressed were you with the presidential speech last night   That had to  wow  that was  RAND   Not much  I guess is one way of putting it PAT   Not much   Yeah RAND   I think that he really has tried to do a bait and switch on us   He thinks that we want to talk about gun control  and thats how were going to stop this  and that this is a domestic situation and we have to do gun control   In reality  we ought to talk about who were going to admit into the country and whether or not we have strict enough scrutiny on those who come to our country STU   Its amazing to see the proposals coming around   Particularly Im totally worked up about this idea of the no fly list meaning that you cant execute your constitutional rights   So can you  because I think to the average person  Senator  you hear a terrorist no fly list  someone who is on that list can just go and buy a firearm  it does seem insane on its face   Can you explain why thats not the case RAND   Well  I guess the way to do it is through an analogy   What if we had a no fly list and we were going to take away First Amendment rights from certain journalists   I think journalists would want some kind of court proceeding before they had their First Amendment taken away   It should be the same for the Second Amendment   Im all for taking away guns of terrorists   In fact  I dont want to let them enter our country to begin with    But the question is  how do we determine who is  and is there some kind of court proceeding   Ted Kennedy was on the watch list   So was Cat Stevens   And so if you have a list like that  and you also understand in the past  over the past several years  they had these things called fusion centers where they gave out lists to policemen within certain states and said  You need to be on the lookout for people who have a pro life bumper sticker  an anti immigration bumper sticker  constitutional party  or people who support Ron Paul   And these were people who were on a watch list in Missouri   And its like  well  for goodness sake  are we going to take away their constitutional rights because some government person put them on a list   So theres a great deal of danger   I would be for it as long as your rights are not taken before you have a court proceeding PAT   Rand  we were talking earlier about Cat Stevens being on the no fly list  and we think he might have deserved it just based on the song Moon Shadow   Do you agree with that RAND   You know  Ive heard that song about 10 million times  and I may not need to hear it again JEFFY   So he agrees    STU   I think hes on board on that one   Thats good   This is amazing PAT   Thats great   Yeah STU   The phrasing from the president last night was really disturbing   He couldnt possibly understand the argument that would  that would make it so that terrorists on a no fly list could get a gun   And its like  well  isnt due process that argument   Is this the same argument weve heard from the left forever that this no fly list shouldnt even exist and that people are being swept up into it unnecessarily RAND   Well  and what theyve done really is a bait and switch   Its all about gun control instead of being about terrorism   And  really  even if you look at it from the gun control aspect  California has everything the left has ever wanted   Every gun control measure that has ever been sought  California has   And yet these people were still able to purchase guns and have them   Why   Because if youre going to commit suicide  if youre going to kill people and commit suicide  you really dont care too much about gun laws PAT   Thats very true STU   Although they would never speed to get away from the incident because of the speeding laws PAT   Right   The speed limit  theyll stay within    RAND   Exactly    PAT   So what is the answer to defeating ISIS in the Middle East   If you were to become president  what is your strategy here RAND   The first thing I would do is I would stop immigration from the Middle East   I think we ought to just put it on a moratorium and say  until we have a better handle on who is already here and whether the people here are obeying our laws  I would just stop immigration from the Middle East   I would also say that if youre coming from Europe  you have to go through global entry   You have to go through a background check    Because the problem is  weve had wide open migration into Europe of large populations   Were talking about hundreds of thousands of people who are against western civilization   Against what the governments of Europe as well as our government is  and so I think you cant just have freedom of travel from Europe to here without some closer scrutiny   So the first thing we got to do is scrutinize travel and scrutinize immigration to our country    The second thing I would do is I would acknowledge that the only lasting peace  the only lasting victory is going to come from Muslim boots on the ground   Arab boots on the ground are going to have to defeat ISIS And the reason is that if American boots on the ground do it or if Europeans do it  they will simply say  Its infidels   Its Christians   Its Crusaders   And another generation rises up   So it has to be Islam saying  This does not represent us   It cant be Americans saying  This doesnt represent Islam  it has to be Muslims saying  This doesnt represent Islam PAT   I like that   Yeah STU   Let me give you some standard horse race analysis here   You tell me why its wrong    People are saying  Rand Paul had this great moment where people were all of a sudden turning Libertarian   Now with all the ISIS attacks and Paris and everything else  now the typical conservative voter is looking back to sort of the policies they used to have  which was more interventionist and jumping into these situations more often   How do you make a case as Rand Paul to win in that environment RAND   You know  the funny thing is that if I werent reading any of the pundits  which I probably shouldnt be doing  but if I werent reading the pundits or looking at the national stories as I travel the country  I think our crowds are bigger  more enthusiastic   I think we  you know  we had over 1 000 kids at a recent college in Iowa   Two different college events   Nearly 1 000 kids   We are drawing large enthusiastic crowds   And I guess I dont see that were not doing very well until I read the stories from the pundits laughter But its also  I think this is the first presidential election that I think weve really led by the nose by pollsters   And I think the polling is less accurate than its ever been   They did polling in Kentucky  and the Republican candidate was said to be down five points with one week to go  and he won by eight points   So they were off by 13 points    If the polls are off and theyre underrepresenting  particularly college kids  where we think were doing well  and among independents  I think we could be doing much better than its actually represented   But the bottom line is  were going to wait and find out from voters   When we hear from voters  you know  I may well reassess   But until then  were in it to win it   And well find out what the voters say February 1st PAT   So how long  how deep can you get into that  into the primary season  Rand RAND   We can go all the way through if people will vote for us   Obviously  you have to look and see what your vote totals are   Were not in it just to stay in it for longevity   And as long as I believe that I can win and as long as the votes come in indicating that  well be  well stay in the race PAT   The next debate is a week from tomorrow   Do you feel like youre under any pressure to do anything spectacular or are you feeling pretty good heading into this RAND   Yeah  Im thinking of singing in my opening   What do you think  a Cat Stevens song STU   Yes PAT   Just so its not Moon Shadow  maybe Peace Train RAND   Now  Peace Train might be a good one for me to open with PAT   Yeah RAND   No   I probably will not sing   My wife has forbidden me from singing outside of the house   So  but  no  I think if we can have a debate like the last one  the last debate had a little more equality of time for the candidates PAT   Yeah  it did RAND   And it was more open for discussion   They let you jump in   So I was allowed to jump in and point out  you know  that I didnt think Marco Rubio was a conservative because he wanted to borrow a trillion dollars in new money   And Im hoping to get to point that out again and again   And I also might want to point out that I dont think hes very good on national defense because hes for an open border  and I think we have to control our border better STU   One last thing  Rand   As a doctor and  of course  obviously all doctors are science deniers  were having this Paris thing go on   And theyre talking about these restrictions on CO2   The projected result of which  if all the science is right  in 85 years  instead of the temperature rising 4 degrees  it would rise 3 95 degrees if fully implemented   We have a president who says he wants to go ahead and walk down this road   Why is it the wrong decision RAND   Well  I think we shouldnt succumb to alarmists and people who believe the end of the world is near   I think that that kind of conclusion really is not very scientific    Ive introduced legislation to say that any treaty that comes out of Paris that he wants to bring back has to be passed as a treaty   So we would actually have to have two thirds of the Senate agree to it if its going to be given to the American people or be enforced or foisted upon us    But I think if you look at the climate change science  if you want to call it science  really  theyve been wrong about almost everything   You know  their modeling has been way off in the last couple of decades   And I think to say that were going to be drowning  the Statue of Liberty is going to be drowning  the polar bears are going to be drowning and all this nonsense  is to go and leap too far    Now  does man have something to do with adding carbon to the atmosphere   Sure   But does nature also have something to do with the cycles that we have with our climate   Have we had times in which weve had much more carbon in the air   Have we had times in which weve been much warmer than this   Yes   I dont think we should jump hysterically to conclusions   We should try to control pollutions  and we should the control of pollution with the economy   We just shouldnt say were just going to cripple our economy in search of something that may or may not be so absolute PAT   How do people get involved if they want to help out with your campaign RAND   RandPaul com   Or go to our Facebook   And we would love to see you there STU   And if you do make a

While the press tried to corner Ted Cruz to get him to place blame of the Colorado shooting this weekend  by a disturbed man  a terrorist  on the rhetoric of the right  something else was happening The University of Chicago canceled classes on Monday after a threat promising to execute approximately 16 white male students and or staff was discovered on the Internet Here is what it said This is my only warning  At 10AM Monday morning  Im going to the campus quad of the University of Chicago  I will be armed with an M 4 carbine and two desert eagles  all fully loaded  I will execute approximately 16 white male students and or staff  which is the same number of time McDonald was killed  I will then die killing any number of white policeman in the process  This is not a joke  I am to do my part and rid the world of white devils  I expect you do the same This is not who we are  But lets play the media game Now where did this come from In 2004 a study was done that showed that this generation was the first to be truly color blind Where did all the race hate come from  How about the hatred for the police It came from the same place and many of the exact same people that spread this disease in the 1960s It is now being drilled into young adults heads by the constant brain washing on the university campus  classrooms  media  MSNBC  democratic socialists  occupy democrats and many in congress and this administration Dont even begin to talk to me about the rhetoric of anyone until you check your own luggage at the door Dont talk to me about how black lives matter until you talk about the 82 people that were shot just this last weekend in Chicago  82 people Dont tell me about the three that were killed in Colorado unless you also talk to me about the 15 that were gunned down and killed in Chicago this last weekend Dont lecture the right about how this killer was a terrorist  which I am fine with  until you can call the killer in Fort Hood  for starts  a terrorist and not a workplace shooter Dont talk to me about rhetoric until you stop training people to hate white devils  the rich  the Christian and those who believe in all of the amendments of the constitution The political class and mainstream media just dont get it  Stop treating people as if they were idiots  They are not  Stop talking down to them and assuming you are better than they are If you are in the media  they pay your salary  You are supposed to be on their side exposing the bad guys  not mocking those who you serve Same with politicians Good and bad alike we will all face the same fate  Look at the universities  You cannot wind people up and then expect to control them  They are eating you first I am tempted to cheer as they pick off these university know it alls one by one as it seems to me that they are getting what they deserve but in the end we all lose Lets stop playing the game Please We must stand together on common sense  decency and integrity I have already asked America for forgiveness for the role I have played in the fraying of our civil discourse  I have soul searched and am trying to do my part now to bring people together and help those in real need Many in the media try to paint conservatives as haters and bigots  But how many in the media know that over 120 000 of my listeners and viewers have raised  12 million to help rescue refugees  Over 12 000 have offered up their own homes to provide shelter Can we not drop the accusations and police our own selves  self examine our side  and come together to be the people we have always been when we come together United we are remarkable people that can accomplish anything and heal the wounds of the world  Divided we are nothing but a forgotten footnote Dare to believe we can be better than this and join me ,0
People dont like that I cannot figure Trump supporters out Amazing how much the Tea Party people love debate and demand to be heard UNLESS  you disagree and believe a celebrity big government progressive is confusing at best and wrong for the country Then shut your mouth or else  Certainly that doesnt sound like what supporters of Obama did in 08 12 While talking to a guy on air today who was a Obama supporter in 08  Lawrence from the Dana Show  who went to the Trump rally last night in Dallas and said friends and family members who voted for Obama in 08 were there as well  he wondered if anyone has learned anything over the last 8 years Well  lots of calls from the Trump zombies wanting me to retract what I said when I thought out loud and questioned  what explains your hatred for the progressive policies of Obama and yet your love for the progressive policies of Trump Is it possible that you except it from Trump and not from Obama because one is on your side  One is Republican and one is not  Is it possible that it really was all about race Maybe  because I cant think of any other reason that excuses such a huge flip flop  This is not just some of the same things  This is almost all of the same things Tea Party people said they were for small government and the Constitution  An IRS that was under control  The fact that Obama really felt universal healthcare was viable we thought was nuts  We said no NSA spying  no executive orders  no flip flopping  no arrogance and maybe some humility How about your disdain for voters that just refused to care about his past  his record and lack of specifics Trump loves America and Obama doesnt  Funny While I think that may be accurate  it isnt what we marched for or anything that was a central issue  If it was just that  maybe we could have survived  But it was his policies  not his motivation In fact  when people said the Tea Partiers felt it was only that he was black  we all made a very strong case that it was the policies that mattered So is it race  Tea Partiers Lets get to specifics He is Obama except He is not a socialist  except he supports many socialist policies He is not a professor and community organizer He is rich although so is Obama now  He is white  Old Here is one comment from a listener that you should ponder Read this and think about it Glenn Beck is spot on  You hated Barack Obamas cult like followers  with their mindless stares of adoration  their impervious barrier between emotion and reason and their instant fury when confronted with the facts about his record  his history or his philosophy But you love it from Trump You hated Obamas shallow  facile rhetoric  with its hollow promises and loose  lowest common denominator word vomit disconnected from any real policy But you love it from Trump You hated how Obama was gleefully lying to credulous  low information voters  filling them with empty promises of economic prosperity that would never come  based on plans that could never be achieved But you love it from Trump You hated how Obama lied about his positions on single payer healthcare  gay marriage  gun control and abortion to get elected  knowing that if he ever revealed the truth about what he believed that hed be unelectable But you love it from Trump You hated how Obama rode the wave of constant attention from the mainstream media into office  and how they played along with his game  draining the life out of every other candidate by describing him as an inevitable juggernaut  an unstoppable political force and a game changer who was tapping into something deep and powerful in American political life But you love it from Trump You hated how Obamas naive ignorance of the real and brutal world of international affairs was papered over by his hollow promises to make the world respect the United States again But you love it from Trump You hated Obamas casual disdain for people who werent from a major city where  you know  all the rich  smart  educated  liberal people like him live But you love it from Trump You hated Obamas elite credentialism  and how he yielded his Harvard and Columbia degrees to browbeat his aspiring class opponents from outside the meritocracy  and how he used them to cow an already docile press But you love it from Trump You hated that smug  arrogant  sneering affect that took hold the moment he thought the cameras werent looking But you love it from Trump You hated Obamas cadre of sleazy  weird  creepy advisers  with their combination of over the edge ideological fervor and their stench of petty corruption But you love it from Trump You hated Obamas support for bail outs  too big to fail and big  taxpayer funded government intervention in dying industries But you love it from Trump You hated his comfy alliance with Harry Reid  Nancy Pelosi and the odious Clinton crime family But you love it from Trump You hated his cavalier disdain for private property rights But you love it from Trump Everything that set your teeth on edge  and raised your hackles and made you loathe Barack Obama is there in Donald Trump  Every aspect of the con game Obama played on America in 2008  the obsessive focus on one base issue  for Obama  the war in Iraq  for Trump  Mexicans  the cult like obsession  the instant attacks on apostates  the willful ignorance of his history and his beliefs  is present in Trump Everything you despised in Obama is there But you love it from Trump  Rick Wilson function d  s  id     var js  fjs   d getElementsByTagName s 0   if  d getElementById id  return   js

Unless youve been living under a rock  youve probably seen that America is being torn apart  Fundamental principles and common sense are being destroyed  Up is down  down is up  and two plus two suddenly equals five  People are losing their jobs because they stand up for religious principles  Politicians espouse whatever stance on is popular at the moment  Gun rights and freedom of speech are attacked at every opportunity  When will it stop Below is a rush transcript of this segment  it may contain errors GLENN   So you remember the song from Lee Greenwood   I mean  its Fourth of July week so well hear it this weekend in every city across America  God Bless the USA   The chorus goes  and Ill gladly stand up next to you   And Ill  and defend her still today   You know that part PAT   Uh huh GLENN   Ive always thought that that part referred to standing side by side on a battlefield   Ill always stand up next to you and defend her still today   But I dont think thats the case now Im sure thats not what he intended when he wrote it   You know  to see our situation   Maybe he did   But I see us standing up defending her here at home without any weapons   I see us standing for the right of conscience If anybody has been paying attention  and you havent been playing politics  just paying attention  America is being torn apart   Were just being ripped apart at the seams   All of our most fundamental principles are being bludgeoned to death   And I say that with full confidence   Hillary Clinton said that traditional marriage was a fundamental  bedrock principle Now she doesnt   That was like eight years ago she said that   A fundamental  bedrock principle   Well  I agree with her   And now its gone   But I think our speech is going away quickly as well   You can say anything you want if you dont mind being hungry for the rest of your life   You cant support your family   If you love unemployment  speak your mind all you want  baby   The CEO of Firefox  fired   Because six years prior he had donated money to a cause in which he believed   Donald Trump this week  fired because he said something I dont agree with  but I dont want him fired for it People working at ESPN  right chink in the armor  fired   Freedom of speech   Nope   Nope   Fundamental  bedrock principle  gone   Freedom of religion  religious institutions in some cases have been forced against their doctrine to provide birth control  contraception  and even abortion   Have you heard the latest on Steve Greens place   Hobby Lobby   Hobby Lobby may have to close Because the government is going after them again   And they just came out and said  we may not be able to stay open this time   Hobby Lobby So dont tell me we have freedom of religion   People are being forced to provide services for ceremonies in which they conscientiously object   Its called a conscientious objector   Weve always had that  that carve out in the Constitution   If your God tells you I cant do that  you dont do it  and no one can force you to do it    But now  Coeur dAlene  Idaho  two ministers who operate church threatened with arrest for not performing a gay wedding ceremony   Arrest  jail time The Supreme Court ruling that came out last week  is that going to help or hurt   Listen to what our first openly gay senator Tammy Baldwin said about religious liberty this week    TAMMY   Certainly the First Amendment says that in institutions of faith  that there is absolute power to  you know  to observe religious deeply held religious beliefs   But I dont think it extends far beyond that GLENN   Okay   It doesnt extend very far beyond that    Say whatever you like in your church  this is James Madison  say  yap all you want   Got this   Got that  whatever   But as soon as you step out on the sidewalk  your ass is mine    I dont think so By the way  so you know how that works  Tammy  if I may call you that  Tammy  a guy who has been in the service forever  forever  Im sorry   No   A guy who is  I was thinking of another religious case This guy is a fire chief in Atlanta   A fire chief He said something inside the walls of his church   He was fired from his job because he said at his church from the pulpit  I dont believe in gay marriage   He was fired   So tell me how that one works  Tammy By the way  the First Amendment doesnt say anything about institutions of faith   What it does say is Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof   Im exercising my faith right now by telling you what I believe The right to keep and bear arms every single time some psycho senselessly takes an innocent life  they roll out the tired  old argument that guns have no place in our society  despite what the Constitution says   The right to be secure in your home  papers  documents  unmolested by authorities  unless there is a probable cause to search or seize your property   Three letters for you   NSA   Heres three more   IRS Those are all gone  gang   Or theyre on the ropes   Power is not delegated to the United States by the Constitution  reserved for the states Yeah   Right laughter No  that doesnt happen   Theres no marriage   Theres no straight marriage in the Constitution That is a power reserved for the states   Not the Constitution   It says it in the Constitution   So the Tenth Amendment is gone   The only thing we have to not really worry about is probably the quartering of soldiers in our homes   Knock on wood   Well  dont knock on wood because that might be a little confusing to some because there might actually be a knock on your wooden door and I dont know it might be the Third Mechanized Infantry Division that is just wanting to stay PAT   Looking for a place GLENN   Can we crash here   Our public schools and universities are turning out kids and theyre turning them into entitlement addicts   It doesnt begin at school   Because even at our sporting events and other extracurricular activities prepare them to expect everything without earning anything   Participation trophies   Telling them that theyre special for no apparent reason   Heaping undue praise on them   Even  when just maybe  constructive criticism would keep a few losers off of American Idol   We told you about UC Berkeley  where Janet Napolitano and her staff are banning certain phrases   These are not words   These are now ideas This week  last week it was UC Berkeley   This week it was University of Wisconsin joining the list of racist microaggressions   Microaggressions   Take your microaggression and America used to be a place where based on your hard work  dedication  and talent  you could have a legitimate chance to get ahead in life   You could actually possibly become successful   Thanks to the University of Wisconsin and UC Berkeley  we discovered now thats just not true   Gaining reward based on your efforts apparently cannot happen   Its referred to as the myth of meritocracy   Saying things like the most qualified person should get the job just accentuates the microaggression that is seething inside of you   Desperately trying to get out What you really mean by that phrase is that people are  of color are given extra unfair benefits because of their race   Why are you such a racist And for the holy love of heaven  will you please dont give me the old  everybody can succeed in this society  if they dont work hard  if they work hard enough   Please dont give that to me   I  you know thats a lie   Go ahead  say it   Say it to your microaggressive  hateful self   Go ahead say it   Colored people are just lazy   Yeah  thats what you say   Colored people   Hello  Mr  1956   Youre saying theyre incompetent and need to work harder   I know exactly what youre saying Yep   Cant hide from the University of Wisconsin or UC Berkeley   This is whats being taught to your kids   Take your kids out of school   Dont   Send them to a local community college before this crap This is whats happening in the United States of America today   The family  the fundamental building block of civilization is being transformed   Marriage transformed   Speech transformed   Rights rewritten   Invented   Suppressed   Its all happening at the same time by design by the progressives And the result will be that Americas cream will no longer rise to the top   Cream  we cant have cream   That implies a cow   Who are you to put your hand on the utter of an animal without asking for permission Merit is going to just be a parts of in Connecticut   Thats it   Well have generations of Americans who wait to be given what they believe they have coming to them because theyre entitled   It wont come  but government benefits will  while they last   More and more fundamental rights will be created There is no fundamental right to marriage   Not in the Constitution   For straight people  either   There is no such thing as a fundamental right for health care   Those are things we like   But thats not something government is doing   Marriage was an institution that was started by the religious   And government cannot interfere with the religious inside the walls of the church   So how is it that they say they can  no  we understand the First Amendment   We got it   You can do whatever you want in the church   And well leave you alone   It just doesnt expand past the church   By the way  open up the door of the church because we have to tell you what youre doing on the altar there with those two people   Cant have it both ways  dude Health care is the same way   Now theyre talking about a guaranteed minimum wage   There is no fundamental right to a minimum wage   A job   Theres no fundamental right to food   Now  these rights did exist in that glorious place called the Soviet Union   They still exist in that wonderful utopia of China   But not here in the United States of America   Why Well  because our fathers had a different idea   And Ill tell you about that coming up in a second BREAK GLENN   So do you remember when the president said this about the Constitution OBAMA   That generally the Constitution is a charter of negative liberties   Says what the states cant do to you   Says what the federal government cant do to you   But it doesnt say what the federal government or the state government must do on your behalf GLENN   Right   Right   He is a constitutional scholar   He has that wrapped up tightly in a nice little box   That is exactly what it says because thats exactly what the founders designed it to do and be   Why   Because they studied all previous governments   They studied it from ancient Greece and Mesopotamia   They went out and they really searched what worked  what didnt  why did it fail  when did it fail   And then they tried to design something that took all of that into account They knew that the government shouldnt do certain things to the citizenry  the way Britain did   They wanted government out of the way   They believed that we can do it   We can do it on our own  and we can do it better   Except for a few things like military   Now  who doesnt think  does Apple think the government can do computers better than Apple   Does Google think they can run the internet better than Google  sic   Do you think you can run your life and your family  or the government would be better at that   Based on merit  were given the right to pursue our happiness   Not the guarantee that the government would provide for us You got to grab your kids because they are being reprogrammed   We are being reprogrammed to accept that the most qualified person should not get the job   That the special person should   The first person  the first black  Hispanic  woman  gay  lesbian  transgendered man thats still questioning and a little bit transabled or maybe the first transracial   First dwarf   First something should get that job   But not the person who is actually qualified   No   Look  if Ted Cruz were gay  he had exactly the same policies  I would absolutely vote for him   If he would just for the love of Pete  man  put on a skirt  then he would be the first transgendered woman president   Then hes  hes more than qualified Were being directed down that path   And if we continue down that path  America will cease to be great   Weve already slid way past good   Were now in  kind of mediocre   Its okay   Kind of like Canada is looking pretty good right now Perhaps one day even less I started this with that Lee Greenwood quote   I think its the first time in my career that Ive quoted Lee Greenwood   But Ill stand up next to you and defend her still today Its time to stand   Its not time to stand against something   Its time to stand for something   Stand for the Constitution   Stand for peoples rights   Not even your rights   Dont even worry about your rights   Somebody elses right   Were going to talk about Ted Cruz and hes talking about his solution to gay marriage   But I think in a way  what hes saying is  we got to stand up against gay marriage and get this thing overturned I think we need to get it overturned  but not because of gay marriage   We got to get the government out of gay marriage   Rand Paul has the right position on this   Get the government out of marriage entirely   They have no place in our marriage   Right of conscience They have no place in our marriage   If you want to get married  you get married   I may disagree with it  but how does it pick my pocket or break my leg   It doesnt You want to get married   Get married   If youre two consenting adults  how does this hurt me If you want to force my church to marry you  if I go to a gay church and theyre like  we wont marry any straight people  so be it   Why would I want them to do it   Im not going to force them to do it   Im not going to force your church or whatever to do whatever   You dont force me to do whatever   Why cant we all just kind of be cool with each other   My evil plan  slowly  quietly take over the world  and then leave everybody alone ,0
On Thursday  Glenn will premiere the latest episode of The Root  entitled Excessive Force  Many have seen the short previews and  for some reason  assume Glenn has gone anti police  Anyone who has watched the show knows this could not be further from the truth  The Root will delve into the militarization of the police  but it will not be anti police by any means  On his TV show Wednesday  Glenn responded to critics and explained exactly what the core issues are that The Root will address Below is a transcript of this segment Tomorrow night is the latest episode of The Root  It is called Excessive Force  and were going to talk tomorrow about this time period from the early 1900s really until today  and were going to show you excessive force with the police and why it is happening I want you to understand  the reason why Im doing this show tomorrow is because of these people and the administration  what these people are doing to try to make the bottom rise up  make the police look totally incompetent so the top comes down so we beg the Justice Department and the FBI  Somebodys got to do something  The top comes down  and were done  This is really important that you understand this history Now  we put a promo together  and some people are already very angry with me  calling me anti police and just about every other name in the book  The title of the program is provocative  but excessive force is not meant in the way the typical liberal anti cop person means  I am by no means anti cop  never have been  never will be  This episode does not bash the actions of individual police officers in any way Tomorrows program is to challenge the direction the local police is heading  I want to show you this promo that already is causing so much controversy with our audience  Watch VIDEO  Glenn  Local police now have the capacity to turn cities both big and small into a war zone  patrolling streets in tanks and armored personnel carriers and geared up with the same fatigues and weapons youd see on a soldier  Rare cases  such force is warranted  but it is becoming the norm rather than the exception Youre going to meet some of the guys that have been doing research on this program for the last couple of months  and I want to remind you that this program has been one of the only programs that has uncovered what the Chicago police are doing  which is a warehouse in the midst of Chicago  and they are using it as almost like a CIA or Guantnamo Bay interrogation room  It goes against everything in the Constitution Were talking about a complete military takeover or military style takeover of our police department for no good reasons  If theyre outgunned  I want them to have the guns  I want them to have the things that they need  Im a guy whos on the border patrol  arm the border patrol  arm them  Let them use their guns  I get it Most rational people will not argue that the police have overused or have begun to overuse the militaristic option  I have a place that we stay in the summers  and its a town of maybe 5 000 people  It has an MRAP  Why does this little teeny town need an MRAP  Now  there are some indisputable facts  SWAT raids have now ballooned out of control  There are 80 000 SWAT raids  and heres the problem  if youre going to take down a violent gang  I want the SWAT there  but most of these 80 000 kicking down the doors and using flash bang grenades are conducted on not violent but nonviolent criminals  many of them misdemeanor criminals This is not the fault of the officer  I believe honestly it is the fault of the city pressuring people to use these things because they paid for them  I explicitly state in The Root tomorrow night  and Ill say it right now  officers cannot be blamed for doing the job theyre asked to do as long as it is within the lines of the Constitution  If youre going to break the Constitution  youre just hey  I was doing what I was told  well  so were the people that were putting the bodies into the incinerator in Germany  Thats no excuse  But as long as youre following Constitution and youre doing the job youre supposed to do and youre fighting for your life  Im with you I argue and state in The Root that because of these policies  I believe our officers are actually being put at a greater risk for injury and harm  As these things spiral out of control  they want the SWAT teams  They want the military on the ground  They want all of these things so the average person looks at them as a victim  and weve got a war going on I will tell you  we never needed it in the United States before  We needed it in the 1960s  It is not a mistake  It is by design that these things are happening again  So  we have to think strategically  and somebody with  300 worth of pot and no criminal history and the weapons  for them to have their door knocked down by a SWAT team in the middle of the nightlet me ask you this  We have a story  I think its in The Root  It may have been on the editing room floor  so if you see it tomorrow  pretend you didnt hear it before Theres a story of a guy  he was a mayor of a town  They were going in to get a typical raid on somebody who had like  300 of pot next door to the mayors house  Well  the SWAT team got the house wrong  and they actually broke down the door of the mayors house  flash bang grenades  put everybody down on the floor  The mayor himself said had I had a gun  I would have drawn that gun because Im a law abiding citizen  I wouldve drawn that gun  and I could have fired at one of those police officers because you think youre being attacked If you have guns in your house and youre a law abiding citizen  to have somebody break into your house  your natural reaction is to draw and shoot  Youre being invaded  He said if I wouldve done that  I wouldve been dead  Thats the mayor of a town  This exact scenario is happening over and over and more and more frequently  Eighty thousand SWAT teams were unleashed in the last year  That is a whole new territory The policy is what were challenging  not the police officers  This is a program  not a condemnation of officers  I want to take some time and just respond to some of the letters  some of the comments that are up here on Facebook that are truly remarkable  Im just going to answer a few of them that are the common complaints This one comes in from Daniel  Should they be wearing ball caps and tennis shorts  You equip with the best available to protect yourself  Daniel  please  dont be insulting  Of course  officers should be appropriately protected I was just at a movie theater last Friday  I go into the movie theater  and heres this woman cop  Shes standing by the popcorn counter  Now  shes working at a movie counter in a suburb of Dallas  okay  I walk up to her  I thank her  and I put my hand on her back  as I do it every single cop I ever see  If I feel a vest  I say  Thank you and thank you for being safe She wasnt wearing one  I tapped her on her back  and I said  The world is changing rapidly  Please  dont go out without a vest  Of course  we address this  Of course we have them dress appropriately  But why the camouflage  Why the military look  Most of the 40 000 raids conducted are nonviolent drug offenders  Listen to that  40 000  80 000  I think in the last year  estimated 40 000 in the last few years  and most of them nonviolent drug offenders  Because of the increased frequency  there are increased mistakes  often with tragic consequences We on this program told you the story of the flash bang that went into a house  and there was a baby in the room  The baby suffered severe burns from it  This is going to happen  The more we do these things  the worse its going to be for the officer and the citizen  Some officers have been shot because the person being raided in the middle of the night has no idea whats going on  They think theyre being robbed by a gang  They shoot The overuse of the military heavy weaponry is what I have a problem with  As I said  in my small town of 5 000 people  there may not even be 5 000 people in that town  they have an MRAP  Ask why do you have an MRAP  Well  sometimes we have to serve a warrant  Does the mob live here  Do you have biker gangs that live here  Did you have a big shootout with somebody  No  unnecessary Peter writes  We dress so we come home  I know that  Believe it or not criminals have stronger weapons than police  Police equip to survive  Take your anti police views to CNN  Okay  Ive never had anti police views  ever  When the subject of a raid is known to have heavy weaponry or suspected to  has a violent history  I am all for taking the SWAT team and go armed to the teeth  The problem is  Peter  the situation you describe is not what is actually happening the majority of the time We can talk about feelings  Id much rather talk about facts  Most of the SWAT raids conducted now are for standard drug warrants involving misdemeanor level criminals who have no violent history  All officers risk their lives every single day  Every day they suit up and put a badge on  theyre risking their life  I know that So  why is it then they dont wear the military gear all the time  Wouldnt that give them the best chance to survive  Of course it would  Why dont we do it  Because we know being policed by a military force rather than a partner in our community is what creates distance between us  Do you think CAIR  International Answer  MoveOn  Color of Change  Code Pink  Open Society  you think it helps to have everybody suited up like a military and MRAPs running through our streets all the time  Do you think thats helping their case or helping your case  I guarantee its helping them say the police are out of control  and theyre going to get you You have people in this country who have always respected the flag  always respected the law  have lived their life  their entire life  being the kind of people that alwaysIm one of themalways goes up to the policemen  even in New York City  and shakes their hand and say  Thank you  I know what youre dealing with  Sometimes I probably dont  but thank you for doing what youre doing  I appreciate it  and so does my family  I always do that Even I and people like me all across the country are starting to have doubts  Why  Because the government is arming the military  You have to look at optics as well  Paul writes  Shame on you Glenn and during National Law Enforcement Memorial Week to boot  Heres a Novel ideawalk a mile in their shoes  I challenge you sirgo spend some time and some of these crime ridden cities on the streets with the Officers No  thank you  No  thank you  I dont know what you go through  but I can guess  Ive driven through many times going to work at a soup kitchen in Bridgeport  Connecticut  I know exactly what a hell hole that is  No  thank you  I know without a shadow of a doubt youll walk away with a deeper understanding and a  sic  abiding respect for our brothers and sisters in Law Enforcement  I already have that  Paul  I have the deepest respect  and I honor the men and women in law enforcement  I always have  I always give them the benefit of the doubt time and time again Have you heard me condemn the police officers in either Missouri at Ferguson or in Baltimore  You havent heard it here  You have heard me say get the bad ones out  but lets let the system work  I know I have talked with countless officers  I very much understand and respect the men and women in blue  Blue lives matter  but that does not mean that I have to agree with the policies that they are being forced to abide by  I actually think those policies are very harmful to the officers you say I dont respect Look  they are arming you to the teeth  and then have you noticed in Ferguson and in Baltimore  they had no go zones  Youre armed to the teeth so you look provocative  and yet theyre holding you back  Why do you think theyre doing that  Why  They are causing the American people to lose trust in you  Nothing youre doing is making the American people lose trust in you  This is orchestrated  and we must know whats going on and what the end of the road is If we were just sitting here talking about violence and what we arm people with  you and I could have a very reasonable conversation  but thats not what were talking about  We are talking tomorrow about who this guy is  who this guy is  the guy who put into motion the militarization of our police force  When you see him in the progressive era and what it has led to  what happened in the 1960s and 1970s and now this coordinated effort  with the president saying we need a well armed police force  a well armed civilian force  I guarantee you  it will not be the local police The president just said Im taking some of this military equipment away  No  hes not  No  he is not  What he really did was say Im not going to sell you tanks  Well  I hope that the police arent saying that they need tanks now  We got that  And he said no grenade launchers  I dont know a cop that says he needs a grenade launcher  So  he is creating the impression he says youre out of control because remember  the police act stupidly  so hes creating the impression that youre out of control  that you have too much stuff  when in reality hes not taking any of that stuff away His people are holding you back while they are calling for the Justice Department to take over local policing  Dont you see the game that is being played  and the cops are being set up  By God  man  Im your best friend because no one else will talk about thisstrategy These policies of increased force and militarization present the police as occupying military  not a partner in the community  That is not the fault of the officer  Let me ask you something  is it a good thing for the police officer to get out and throw a football with a kid on the street  Absolutely  Why  Because it shows the cops to be just like you  part of the community  Hey  you can trust them  When they come rolling in an MRAP to serve a warrant on your neighbor  what the hell is that  Thats not part of the community  Thats an occupying force to many Americans  and unfortunately  our cops will suffer the consequences of these policies I invite you to watch the program tomorrow night and see if it changes your mind  It may not  It may not  I know that we have done months of homework on this particular program  months  I dont expect to be popular with everybody  I know my views are controversial  I accept that  My job is to tell you the truth  whether you like it or not  the way I find it The problem is not the police officer  It is the policy of increased militarization  This is new  I dont have a problem with our police officers  I have a problem with the Department of Homeland Security  And what else  What are they calling for  What is this top that will come down  I believe what our president  this administration  and many in Congress are lining up for is out of line with the vision of our framers  and Im sorry  the Constitution is not just a cute rule of thumb  The Constitution is the law of the land  If you dont like it  we should amend it  There are those who just want to overthrow it or dismiss it  I am neither of those two Taylor wrote and said  If they have ak47 and Im going into a house I at least want a  sic  m4 or something of equal stopping power  We are not fighting gangs with sling shots people  I got it  I got it  If theres a raid and we know they have AK 47s or we have reasonable belief that they do  by all means  lock and load  no problem  but you cannot apply that logic to the patrol of regular city streets because if you do  then my argument  just to be consistent  is we dont know what the bad guys could have Were dealing with ISIS coming across our border  They might have RPGs  We better have armored vehicles and MRAPs for all routine patrols just in case  You cannot go down that road  Jason  Take the military equipment away from the police and when the situation arises when that equipment is needed youll have to call out the actual military  Be careful what you wish for  Dont think that I havent thought that one through  I never said take the equipment away from the police  What Im arguing is exactly what you saywhen the equipment is needed  it should be the only time its used  not to serve warrants  This is not the reality now80 000 SWAT events  80 000 SWAT events When you see what a SWAT team was originally designed to be  itll make a lot of sense  It is being unnecessarily used  I invite you to go beyond judge a book by the cover  Dont judge a program by a trailer  Watch the program for yourself  While I understand seeing the phrase excessive force in the headline can be misconstrued as typical anti cop  Occupy Wall Street nonsense  I do not accept that from my thinking fans This is in no way with this program is about  I know many police officers who dont agree with the overuse of military tactics  I know police officers  I know military men who are gravely concerned about the way we are using our police on the local level  They are concerned for your safety  your lives  and the future of our police departments There are times when force is justified  and I have no problem with those in those instances  When the case is borderline  I side with the judgment of the police  But lets talk facts ,0
The Islamic State and other factions of psychotic Islam have targeted Coptic Christians in the Middle East  In fact  it was estimated over 4 000 Coptic Christians were murdered in the region last year  But its a story you rarely hear on the mainstream media  and Barack Obama and his administration have done everything in their power to strip away any connections between Islam and these insane acts of violence  On TV last night  Glenn asked why more Christians here in America arent standing up against this horror Below is a transcript of this segment When Pope Francis comes out and he talks about gay marriage or redistribution of wealth  everybody all around the world  it is headlines  front page  media is all over it  but when he comes out and condemns the complicit silence about the killing of Christians all around the globe as he did on Good Friday  its deafening silence I seem to remember a promise we made to each other   We seemed to make a promise we would never let the world fall into this darkness again  we would never let a Holocaust happen again  and yet here we sit  willfully blinded  even indifferent  as Christians continue to be slaughtered by radical Islamic monsters  The latest came last Thursday when students at a Kenyan university were finishing up classes and preparing for the holiday weekend   It was just like any other day until radical Islamist terrorists stormed into the campus and proceeded to unleash a violent  ruthless assault that lasted 13 hours and left 147 dead   Many are still missing and unaccounted for This is the worst attack since the bombing of the US Embassy in Nairobi back in 1998   They went room by room   They grabbed the students and then began to interrogate about religion   If you were Christian  you were shot on the spot   Many were decapitated   According to witnesses  any student attending the morning prayers at mosque were not attacked The terror group responsible  al Shabaab  they took responsibility for what they called an operation against infidels   We sorted people out and released the Muslims   There are many dead bodies of Christians inside the building   We are also holding many Christians alive Imagine being a father  your child or your daughter is off at college  and you hear about this attack   You know that your daughter is at that college   The daughter called in the morning in a panic during the attack   Later in the day  the parents phone rang again   It was a man on the other end   He demanded that he talk to the Kenyan president within two minutes   The family said we dont have access to the Kenyan president  we cant put him on the phone   He said  Im going to kill your daughter   They heard gunshots over the phone   The man said  She is now with her God  and dropped the phone to the floor   In February  22 Egyptian Coptic Christians were beheaded by ISIS   Weve shown you this video many times   The intentional move to strip away any mention of Islamic when talking about the extremists  the psychos  the terrorists  makes identifying and defeating the enemy even more difficult   President Obama didnt even identify the victims Christianity when they were beheaded by ISIS on the beach merely for being Christians   By doing so  it keeps the motive for the violence hidden    According to Open Doors  4 344 Christians have been killed for faith related reasons between December 1 and November 30 of last year   Thats double from the previous year   That number is much likely much higher because the group only counts victims who they can identify by name and an exact cause of death can be determined   Christians have also routinely been targeted in Iraq and Syria   ISIS has become genocidal   They had a march in Iraqs Nineveh plain last August   Then they moved to Khaybar   They executed and exiled religious minorities like the Yazidis while we did nothing   They destroyed Assyrian artifacts in Iraq while we did nothing   They blew up an 80 year old Assyrian church on Easter while we did nothing   Christians are being driven from the Middle East in what some have called the new Exodus    Part of the problem leading to the increased persecution is the fact that Christianity has spread   Kenya is now 82  Christian   Kenya has been repeatedly attacked by al Shabaab terrorists   We just talked about the university attack   Before that it was the 2013 mall attack where they lined the Christians up  demanded they quote verses from the Koran   Anyone who could was let go  anyone who couldnt  murdered  Before that it was the 2012 attack on churches during Sunday servicesfamilies with their children   Our world leaderssorry  calling them that is laughable   Our world leaders are anything but leaders  and they can sanitize the language all they want  but it is psychotic Islam that is causing this   The radicals are not mincing words   This is a religious war for them   This is the beginning of a Christian genocide for them  and it is getting worse   After theyre done with the Christians  they will go to the Jews and the Muslims In Egypt  Coptic Christians building a church in honor of those beheaded by ISIS were attacked late at night with Molotov cocktails   They set cars on fire   Stones and bricks were thrown   After meeting with an organizing group  something organized by the local governor  it was decided that the location of the church would be moved    Last month  ISIS went door to door in Libya searching for Coptic Christians  Christians among a compound housing day laborers   Put yourself in this mans position   Hes a day laborer   Theres a knock on his door   He opens it at night   He has the horrifying realization of who is standing on the other side of his threshold  and they asked if he and his roommate were Christians   He only had a split second to think   He lied   He said  No  I Muslim   They asked if any of the rooms had any Christians in it   He lied again   He and his three friends survived  but thirteen others were taken away   Later they were beheaded on a beach as part of the propaganda video Coptic Christians  they are the largest Christian denomination in Egypt and part of the largest Christian community in the Middle East  but they are a minority of the entire population  accounting for only 10   So you know  a lot of people will say  What is a Coptic Christian   I dont know what it means   Copt comes from the Greek word meaning Egyptian  so all Egyptians at one point were Copts  but over time and several Muslim conquests  they began using Coptic or Copt as a derogatory term to refer to anyone who didnt convert to Islam Remember  Egypt at one time was a Christian nation   Not anymore  and there are not going to be any Christians left in the entire Middle East unless somebody does something   This scene has played out over and over again   Its played out before   In the upcoming episode of The Root  we are going to chronicle the history of Christian persecution that took place over the last 100 years in the Middle East Few recognize it in full context  but when you see it  you will understand what is motivating these extremists  and its not American foreign policy   Its not even our culture   Its a religious war  and amazingly world leaders are turning a blind eye   The pope admonished  but because he wasnt talking about redistribution of wealth  no one seemed to listen Ive been talking about this for so long that I cant imagine why you even watch or listen anymore   It sounds crazy to say it   To Jewish people  its offensive to say this is a Christian Holocaust   That word is reserved for a special place  and I understand that  but we better start telling each other the truth   What is coming is a Christian Holocaust   It appears we have forgotten the promise never again Its why Jews are coming up to me now saying  Please  talk about the Christians   Its why were seeing more and more citizens  people just like you  pack up and go to the Middle Eastnot to fight for ISIS  but to fight for the other side  to protect the Christians   We had a guy on the program named Matthew VanDyke   Hes trying to train Iraqis and Syrians to defend themselves against ISIS because were not doing any of it   TheBlaze today has an amazing story  an exclusive video  featuring a group of American volunteers fighting with the Kurdish Peshmerga against ISIS   It is absolutely breathtaking video as snipers have them pinned down  and you hear the bullets whizzing by   One volunteer gets hit in the leg as they retreat   Its an incredible story and an incredible video Why is this happening   Because we no longer as a countryand if I may  we no longer as Christians even stand for anything   The people who do realize what is happening in the world are sick and tired of inaction  so theyre literally doing it themselves   I dont know if thats a good idea or a bad idea   They have more bravery than I do Another amazing story  a Los Angeles based nonprofit is also taking action   Theyre dedicating their efforts to helping girls and children who have escaped the horrors of ISIS in Iraq   You know what pisses me off   How people just spend their time prattling on about a war on women because of birth control   ISIS is ground zero for a war on womenrape  torture  selling into sex slavery   These are people and families just like yours  and the only reason why theyre being sold into sex slavery and being broken up as families and beheaded is because they are Christian We promised never again   Isnt it time we put up or shut up   And I mean as people   We as people failed to listen to people like George Clooney on the Sudan   We wanted to make it about politics   And Im not saying us  per se   I asked George Clooney   I remember being in the radio studio a few years back  and I asked George Clooney   I said  Please  lets partner with this  because I care just as much as you do   It never happened because people want to play politics   Lets not   What do you say lets not Our politicians have failed to publicly denounce the Armenian genocide   Its the 100th anniversary this month   That is really  really important   Why   Youll understand when we show you The Root   Were doing a special on the anniversary of the Armenian genocide  and we hope the world will finally see what the truth really is and why that was important  why its important today to recognize what the Turks did to the Christians and the Armenians I dont know what were building towards   I do  I think   I dont even want to say it out loud   This is not separate from my trip to Auschwitz   I feel it in my bones   This is not separate from me telling my children four  five years ago we have to educate ourselves  we have to know who we are  we have to decide to become the Righteous Among the Nations before it begins to happen   I hoped that that would all go away  but I dont think its going to I was on Facebook last night because I posted some video  and theres an update on that video that I posted last nighthorrible  horrible stuff   I said  When are Christians going to wake up   Somebody said  What do we do   I said  Heres what you do  you go to your pastors and your priests and your rabbis  and you ask them  A  is there a Coptic Christian church in our area    B  Can we reach out to them   Can we comfort those who are supposed to be mourning   And why arent you talking about this every single Sunday from the pulpit You wouldnt believe the response I got   So many people said  What is that going to do   Glenn Beck  thats a dumb answer   Is it   How about educating yourself first   How about educating others first   How about then going to our pulpits   The American Revolution  the Civil War  and the civil rights movement came and were won from the pulpit first   Our pulpits should be on fire  but our pulpits are barely an ember Its shameful what is happening   Dietrich Bonhoeffer  not to speak is to speak  not to stand is to stand  not to watch is to watch   Dont you see  because of technology  God is condemning all of us now   We can see it   We couldnt see the Holocaust before   We can see it this time   He is condemning us You say I dont want to watch it   I dont know how many people said  I dont want to watch it   I dont want to watch it   I dont want to watch it   Why   Why dont you want to watch it   Well  because youll never be able to unsee it   Good   You should be able to watch it and never unsee it    How many horror movies do we watch   How many things do we see over and over again   Were putting that garbage  that filth  into our head  and then when it really happens  I dont want to watch it   Why not   Because you know it condemns you once youve seen it   Ive got news for you  you have access to it   Not to watch is to watch   Youre making a choice   God will not hold us blameless  so I suggest that you reach out to the Coptic Christians   They are persecuted   They need your help   I suggest that you reach out to your pastor  your priest  and your rabbi  and if he wont do it  you do it   Weve got to stand together   There is powerful evil   Remember what Paulina told me  the woman who was one of the Righteous Among the Nations   She said the righteous didnt suddenly become righteous  they just didnt go over the cliff with everybody else   Everybody else is going over the cliff   Theyre going over the cliff  and what is the cliff   The cliff is I dont want to see it  I dont want to think about it  I cant do anything about it   Dont go over the cliff   Dont   Stand You know whats right   You may not know what you can do   Maybe all you can do is pray like youve never prayed before   Maybe all you can do is seek out somebody who is actually going over there and fund them   Maybe you can go over   Maybe you are a priest or a pastor or a rabbi   You were born for times such as this ,0
Glenn wrapped up SpyWeek on TheBlaze last night with a chilling look at where the surveillance state is heading next  What sort of world are we creating for our children and grandchildren  One vastly different from ours where all the rules of the game are changed Watch a portion of the conversation below Glenn  All right  I want to talk to a couple of other people and bring them in  Bruce Schneier is the author of Data and Goliath  Also  Whitfield Diffie  he is an American cryptographer and author of Privacy on the Line  Welcome  gentlemen Bruce  Thank you Glenn  Okay  so were just kind of having an interesting conversation off the air about this is something that everybody should be concerned about  and you were saying that it kind of breaks down to two different groups  people who fear corporations  the people who fear the state  but really both sides should care Bruce  I call it the security industrial complex  You know  it isnt that the NSA woke up one morning and said were going to spy on everybody  They woke up in the morning and said  Wow  all these corporations are spying on everybody  Were going to get ourselves a copy  and whether its Google or Facebook or your cell phone companies  this data is being collected for persuasion  right  for advertising  and a lot of government surveillance programs piggyback on that We just learned today in an article in The Intercept that the NSA broke into the largest SIM card manufacturerthats the little card in your cell phone that makes it your cell phonea Netherlands company and stole all of the SIM numbers or basically all of the keys for everything  Now  we knew they did that piecemeal  but everything  Thats kind of impressive  but they couldnt do that Glenn  What does it mean Bruce  You know  were still figuring out what it means  but basically each one of your phones has a card in it with keys  and that provides security  What the NSA did  NSA  GCHQ  were not sure which  broke into the manufacturer and stole all the secret numbers  and we believe it means they can eavesdrop on any phone  Exactly the details were still figuring out  but this is extraordinary  but it was impossible if these phones didnt have that information in them Glenn  Youre a cryptologist  Any way around any of this Whitfield  You can look at this from two sides  I think were entering a golden age of intelligence  I told that to my Mike Hayden years ago when he was head of NSA  and now I think he knew it already maybe as well as I did Glenn  When did you tell him that Whitfield  It would be about 2004 Glenn I talked to the Department of Homeland Security  I cant remember who was the first guy  Ashcroft  I talked to him right after Department of Homeland Security  and I had my cell phone down on the desk  and he asked for it to be removed  We were on the air  and he asked for it to be removed  When we were off the air  he said to me nobody I know has a cell phone or sends an email  You shouldnt  That was crazy  They knew Bruce  But thats not a way to live Whitfield  Youre not going to turn a profit that way Bruce  Right  you have to send email  You need a cell phone  You have to be on Facebook  These are parts of our lives  and turning them off saying we choose not to engage  youre going to be a freak and a social pariah Glenn  But how do you get away from it  They would know  theres a record now forever for all time that the three of us were together  so you do something  now Im connected to you for all time Whitfield  You might keep it quiet  having a popular show Glenn  Yeah  I know  but I mean  everything in your life is connected  everything now Whitfield  Well  let me ask you a fundamental question  do you think human autonomy can possibly stand against improving communications Glenn  Yes Whitfield  I mean  look at everything from a truck driver who used to have 30 years ago his boss said get this load from San Diego to Chicago  Youve got four days  Truck driver is pretty much his own boss over that period of time to today  the truck is tracked at every instant  Its not LoJack for trucks  Its Teletrac  To the top level  you have a commander out in the field  and the notion of the commander and chief power now means that the president can call him up on a secure phone and say do this  You know  time of the Constitution  presidents power was to appoint generals  tell them what he wanted done  When they got back  he could court martial  So  I think everything  your autonomy in general without conscious societal decisions to defend it  will be subsumed in the fact that its not so much the NSA can watch you  that your boss can watch you  that your friends can watch you  that your spouse can watch you Glenn  Is there going to be or is there even now anything such as privacy Bruce  Certainly  there is  Privacy isnt gone  Theres lots of ways its being invaded because there are so many digital intermediaries in our lives  Everything we do largely requires computers  Computers produce this data  You know  weve seen as technology improves this data is now cheaper to save  cheaper to store  You talked about the Utah data center  Thats where the NSA store it  Google has their own data storage  Everybody is storing this data  but thats not inevitable  It doesnt have to be that way  We can take pains to limit the data we produce  and we can hopefully control both government and corporate collection use surveillance Glenn  Whos going to do that Bruce  This is the problem Glenn  I mean  I had a guy  former NSA  was one of the guys that they  you know  broke down his front door  came in  and he was in the shower and held a gun to his head because he was against the data collection  He said  Glenn  youll never stop it  because  a  everybody in Washington is in on it  and  b  theres data on everybody  Whos going to stop it Bruce  I tend to be short term pessimistic and long term optimistic  I think in the near term youre right that the government is punch drunk on this data  Corporations are punch drunk on this data  Theres so much out there  Theres this belief in big data that its valuable  and we should save it  I mean  thats why its being saved  When you talk to people inside the government and counterterrorism  they know these broad surveillance programs dont work  For them its an insurance policy  Its a very expensive insurance policy  Long term  though  I think we figure this out  I mean  this is not something thats inevitable  It might take us a generation  but I actually believe that we will get to a place where privacy is valued and preserved Glenn  How Whitfield  Privacy is a pretty dodgy concept  I mean  I think people often talk about  you know  about the old dayswe lived in small towns and so forth  and then people observe  you know  small towns are not actually that friendly to privacy  Your neighbors know all about you  The critical thing is you also know all about your neighbors  You see them every day  You buy and sell from them  You work with them  They are answerable to you  When these remote big data companies are tracking us  they are no way answerable to us  They can take actions that will affect our lives  will affect whether we can get jobs  affect the cost of insurance  and its a great deal of trouble for us even to find out its going on  let alone to hold them to account for it Bruce  I think thats important  Its the power imbalance  When you think about transparency versus privacy  its all about the powerful versus the powerless  We like transparency in government  It reduces government power  better liberty Whitfield  And the government doesnt like it for the same reason Bruce  Right  and the government wants secrecy which increases the power imbalance  We want privacy of individuals which reduces the power imbalance  How we get there  I think we have to agitate for political change  I mean  this is going to be hard  Were fighting strong lobbies  Were fighting strong government interests  and we are producing this data  Were leaving this enormous data shadow Glenn  Okay  so lets talk about the data footprint and reducing the data footprint  what the average person can do  I know you have some tips  so well go through those and then also  what does advocacy mean  What does stand up for your rights really mean on this  How do you do that  When we come back ,0
We saw Selma tonight  I really wanted to see it but at the same time I worried about the spin of the story  It is an Oprah movie  She attended Jeremiah Wrights church  If she could sit through those sermons  God only knows what she really believes  The last thing I want to do is be preached to about how racist America is Would it be a message movie or would they tell the whole truth and let it speak for itself I am thrilled to say  this is a movie that every American should see First  Every cop killer  looter  liar and take it because Ive been wronged and I am owed good things American needs to watch  Listen in particular to what a friend of Coretta Scott King says to her before she goes in to speak to Malcolm X We come from a proud and noble people  People who have struggled and fought and survived slave ships  But created great civilizations  We were the first people  We can overcome anything  We are Noble They need to watch to see what people went through so they COULD VOTE  They just wanted to have control of their lives and make their own way fairly  They were educated against all odds  brave for no reason and had tremendous faith even though God hadnt be clearly present for a long time Inspiring and damning of todays attitude and behavior I was also shocked and glad they told the truth about mlks personal flaws  I am glad that they did not harp on it  but they did address it  I thought this was important  It shows that he was not perfect and that if we just are willing to obey Him  he will not be thwarted  He will use anyone who says  I may be afraid  but I will do as you ask  Watch the kneeling scene on the bridge  powerful God moment  Again  willing to be unpopular because a God told him Important to note that 1 3 of those marching were white Every progressive should see LBJ in all his racist glory  Notice the painting of Andrew Jackson on his wall  Anti hero  Read up on how the civil right act was originally a republican bill that LbJ blocked in the senate in the late 1950s  That it was the republicans who were the champions not the democrats   kennedys were the exception  Especially RFK Dont let the movie fool you on one very important point  George Wallace was a DEMOCRAT  HIS ENTIRE LIFE  The only flaw beside historical nit picking  Resolute desk was in the Smithsonian after JFK and not in the Oval etc  was the fact that they tried to make Wallace look like a Republican  He was against LBJ  liberals and progressives  He was a Democrat  It can happen just as I am against the progressives in the Republican Party but it bothered me I am not saying all Democrats are bad and Republicans are good  That is clearly not true  However lets make sure we are telling history correctly The important thing for those on the left to see is the role of God in the civil rights movement  They could have skated around this but they didnt  I was really pleased to see how much of a role they allowed God to play in this movie  It makes all the difference if you really want to tell the truth Now  it is equally important for those on the right to see this film  Many think we are living the civil rights era again I do not believe we are  yet there are some of the same roots  The targeting of king and anyone who stands against the power in DC  The loss of rights although no where to the extent of what blacks went through To me this film tells me it will be our children  black and white  left and right  that will fight this battle and not us  Will they be prepared  educated and humble enough to stand for all men are created equal note the opening scene with Oprahs character  How she handled herself was much more like a Tea Party person than an Occupy Wall Street or Black Lives Matter protestor These people were heroes  We should be so lucky to be this brave  restrained and smart The movie also shows the want of many to run to violence and guns  The Malcolm X character is important  You hear many things that I have heard from the outer fringes of the people who think the Tea Party doesnt go far enough  You will see why the right lost at the Bundy Ranch Humility  a non violent posture at all times is critical and the only way to win Important note  the right has not been violent  OWS was  Unions  SEIU  were  However  look at the images here  The bad guys were the ones shouting  pointing and pointing guns  The good guys were quiet  humble  open  meek  God fearing  kind  defenseless I dont think it was needed but the film did only hint to Malcolm Xs change of heart as he fell away from the Nation of Islam  I think this is important to address somewhere as the NOI is growing in the black community once again It is not a coincidence that Sirhan Sirhan killed RFK over Israel  JFK was killed by a communist  Malcolm X was killed by Islam and MLKwas killed by a hate filled racist BE NONE OF THOSE THINGS AND CHANGE THE WORLD If you want to understand history  see a compelling movie  great acting and directing  a message we can all learn from WITHOUT IT BEING A MESSAGE MOVIE  and you want to see what real struggle is like  how Americans can and do come together when they see real injustice and how NOBLE and God fearing people who seek to love change the world  SEE SELMA ,0
Not the organized mob  that we know of  but rather angry mobs  While discussing the fruitlessness of violent mob tactics  Jeffy revealed his mother in law was the victim of an angry mob after the MLK assassination  describing a horrifying subway ride that resulted in a severe beating just because she was white   GLENN  Okay   Lets talk a little bit about the riots PAT  Theyre blocking bridges   Theyre stopping people from going to work   This is starting to spread all over the country   Second night of protests GLENN  Its all right   This is Occupy Wall Street 2 PAT  It is GLENN  Thats all this is   They think they have a chance   America is not going to be with these radicals   Theyre not going to do it PAT  I hope thats true GLENN  It is PAT  I hope that the people who are protesting realize that this time  theres almost  theres bipartisan support here   Theres biracial support here GLENN  Its important to say  we dont know what happened in the grand jury room PAT  They said it a hundred times yesterday GLENN  We dont know what happened in the grand jury room  and so you know  I dont know what they were instructed that they had to pay attention to   I dont know what the evidence was   I wasnt there   But thats  what I said yesterday is I would like to see  I mean  we need transparency here   They need to say  to the to the American people  what  why the grand jury didnt think this was wrong PAT  And they need to do that because we saw what happened with our own eyes GLENN  Right PAT  So  GLENN  So its they got it wrong and the system needs to be fixed or we dont know something that they know   Either way  we need to know that   When it comes to Michael Brown  we know that there were black eyewitnesses that did not come out in front of the American people because they were afraid for their own life and protection   But they went and they testified that  yes  the cop was right   And so thats what really set the Michael Brown thing up  was the testimony of African Americans who went into the grand jury and said  no  Michael Brown was trying to harm the police officer   It was self defense and it was  it was a righteous shooting   That wasnt  they werent out in front of the press because they were afraid   But at least we know that   Here  we dont have anything but the videotape that shows this  these cops looking like theyre out of control   So its important  but youll never get this  because de Blasio wants this kind of action on the street   So youre never going to get this   But its important for the American people to see what happened   How was justice served in this   Tell us why that decision was made   Its important PAT  I think it is   You know  and heres the case where we agree with the sentiment   It looks to us to be a miscarriage of justice   But theres a right way to go about it and a wrong way to go about it and I think to punish commuters on their way to or from work is the wrong work GLENN  Its the wrong way PAT  Its just going piss people off GLENN  When you go back and look at the riots  the workers world riots in the 1930s and you will see this is exactly the same kind of stuff with FDR   They set Oakland on fire   They set several cities on fire   They were beating people in the streets   I mean  it was bad   This has happened before JEFFY  Oh  my gosh  when you talk about knowing your family history and what happened  over Thanksgiving I learned something new about my mother in law that I never knew before   She was here fresh in the United States from Ecuador in New York City on a subway the day of Martin Luther King  GLENN  Hold on PAT  Theres an important element here GLENN  Please tell me that somehow or another your family members here illegally and theres someway we can get you deported JEFFY  So anyway  the night that Martin Luther King was assassinated  shes on a subway and she was beaten almost to death for being  looking white   And the violence was just there   And a person who tried to break it up was eventually stabbed by this crowd and that was just for being on the subway and looking white PAT  Did he survive JEFFY  No  I dont think he did   She wasnt sure   She said she didnt think he didnt make it and she almost didnt make it   But at first  GLENN  It meant a lot to her that somebody saved her life and died for her PAT  Thats the nice way to turn this on  GLENN  Right PAT  On the Jeffy clan GLENN  Meant so much she didnt even check to see if the guy lived PAT  Here he is making  overlapping speakers JEFFY  No  no GLENN  Youre right   Youre right   Those happen so rarely PAT  They happen so rarely GLENN  I didnt mean to  go ahead PAT  Go ahead GLENN  That is your moment to shine JEFFY  Were long gone done now GLENN  No  go ahead   Somebody in your family that people wanted to beat to death   What a surprise laughing JEFFY  She wasnt part of my family then   I went out looking for people like that GLENN  They knew   Your daughter is going to marry somebody in the future and I know it and I got to beat you to death   So thats amazing   Thats amazing PAT  Yeah  it is JEFFY  But its just random   Doesnt matter   So thats when you stop traffic  you make people mad PAT  And it doesnt help the cause JEFFY  It doesnt help anything GLENN  This is what happens  honestly  this is the kind of stuff that happened with Gandhi PAT  And youve said it a million times  this is why MLK won because it was peaceful GLENN  And its why Gandhi won   Its important to understand  Gandhi did not win because he was doing a hunger strike against England or against the oppressors   He didnt   He did a hunger strike on his own people   You want violence   You want to beat people in the streets   You want to bring a gun   You want to burn something down   Im not with you   And he was so beloved   He said I will starve to death  I will not eat   I will starve to death before I will stand with you   And if you decide to disarm  if you decide to be peaceful  Ill eat   Ill have water   But until that time  no   Now  where is Jessie Jackson   Where is Al Sharpton   Can you imagine if anybody on that side would have so much credibility that they would stand and up say  until you come to the table  I will not eat   Not preaching  Gandhi was not preaching to the man   He was preaching to the people on the streets   Thats the difference   Thats the difference    ,0
The article below is the personal  unedited account from Mark Mabry of his experience with Operation Underground Railroad and their mission in Colombia  Mark is a former employee of Mercury Radio Arts and TheBlaze  and he has volunteered time to work with OUR By Mark Mabry To keep the deal alive  Raul ratcheted up the intensity of his texts I have a special gift for you Jefe  I call her Lady She is fresca She is a virgin  just for you   She is eleven   Pablo responded in kind I cannot wait This could be a beautiful arrangement Raul writes back I will not fail you boss   I believe God has put us on this path together   Pablo agrees So do I Big child trafficking deals are actual deals just like slave trading two centuries ago  Text messages are the new quill and paper  Cell phone pictures are the new auction block Here are some facts of this deal Fact One  Pablo is actually Paul H  a billion dollar fund manager from the United States  Hes in his forties with three teenage sonsTwo weeks ago he visited Colombia and was introduced to Raul at a rooftop restaurant Fact Two  Raul is about 31  Hes handsome  networked  and smart  He used to be involved in cyber fraud and also worked for a Latin American drug cartel until being placed under house arrest  Shortly after he was released in 2012 his cartel was wiped out by rival cartels in Mexico  He survived  disappeared into Colombia  and started to freelance in high margin child sex trafficking and tourism  Hes a staple of the Cartagena party scene Fact Three  Lady  the eleven year old  really is a virgin  For over a year  Raul has fed her a steady diet of hard porn  live sex demonstrations  drugs  alcohol  promises reserved for the rich  and threats reserved for the captive  The technical term for this training is grooming Sex with a virgin child costs around  1000  After that  her rate will decrease with age  Her ability to service several clients a day will have to increase in order to capture the precious few years of youth 10 00 AM  Saturday Oct 11  Baru Island  Colombia  Pablo waits for Raul at a remote beach house  He stands on the dock outside  his blonde hair is fund manager standard  high and tight  he looks like Richie Rich  thirty years later  in resort wear 10 05 Three boats pull up  Raul disembarks the 40 foot speedboat with a group of adults  He waits for the two tour boats that were traveling in the convoy to dock and empty out  Raul finds Lady and walks her down the dock to the large room designated for the kids Ladys form fitting shirt reads Sleepy Head andis actually a pajama top  Her black Colombian hair is streaked with amateur pink dye  Lady is skinny  flat chested  and walks without any hip action Raul  wearing jeans and Sunday shoes  has only met Paul one other time  on a Cartagena rooftop restaurant about two weeks ago  Prior to that  all of the contact was with Tim  the party organizerwho diligently learned about all of Rauls inventoryeven traveling to Cartagena on numerous occasionsall to serve Jefe Raul finds Tim and Paul You will love Lady  but I have additional gifts for you Jefe  says Raul Behind Rauls smile was a gift of four  11 year old virgins   3 girls and a little boy  By todays rates  its a  4000 goodwill offering Fuego  Rauls street man  prods the kids toward the houseto await the party Pauls 15 friends make catcalls from the beach  Music blares from a Bluetooth speaker on a card table  Some of the guys play poker and drink  One guy flies a remote control drone out over the ocean  but most of them are content to watch and snap pictures on their iPhones In all it was a 54 victim parade  most of them were 9th grade or under Raul motions to Tim  his American contact  who was brokering the deal  Send them back to prepare for the party Three beautiful American women escort the children back to a large room with several beds  These were the same three women who greeted and inspected the kids at the shipping dock in Cartagena 45 minutes prior  Its customary at a child sex party to have someone to groom and clean the kids  babysit them  between sessions Fact Four  Tim has organized child sex excursions for about a decade  The price tag on this trip would be about  65k  not including  20 000 for a full day with 54 kids   The actual price would have been  24 000 had Raul charged for the additional for virgins But before you jump to any conclusions about Tim  understand one more fact The sex excursions that hes organized have all been to rescue the children and bust the bad guys  Tim founded Operation Underground Railroad  OUR  over a year ago  and the organization acts just like the name sounds  Prior to OUR  he worked in the Department of Homeland Security solving crimes against children from child trafficking to child pornography  But Tim wanted the freedom to move more nimbly and even to free kids outside of the U S  governments jurisdiction  So Tim left the government to push the issue faster  His speed to save has skyrocketed and the efficiency of dollars spent to children saved has increased exponentially  He was also now an equal opportunity catcher of bad guys  every body is game  not just Americans Increasingly donors have come forward and funded missions  some for as little as  15 000 and other missions exceeding  100 000  Every child has a price though  and in the dark world of child trafficking  a kids freedom  or captivity  most often comes down to the guy who can come up with the cash This was my second mission as an embedded journalist  My first mission was in Haiti  6 months ago  Im finding increasingly that journalistic detachment in matters involving the rape of children is a joke and that the process of pealing back layers of child sex trafficking involves moving beyond the confusing exterior of 13 year old girls groomed for sex and dressed for the part  It involves seeing this evil for what it is  the same thing that it was for hundreds of years with African slaves flesh selling flesh Tim architected this particular plan from its inception months ago as part of the largest one day sting operation in child trafficking enforcement history  In fact  concurrent missions were being conducted by trained OUR operatives in Medellin and Armenia  Colombia  And so far  all three missions were going exactly according to plan Back on the little island  the men retired to an outdoor dining area to discuss plans for a luxury hotel built for child sex tours  Paul would finance it and Raul would run it  Seven other Colombians sat at the table too In addition to Raul  there was an older man  a cocaine guy Then there was Fuego  Rauls street guy  Nothing was too hard for Fuego to get  He wore a Che hat at the dock  Tim congratulated him on the great hat and Fuego explained  Che was a revolutionary  so am I  Im a revolutionary dealer of the Chicas Interesting side note  Tim traded Fuego hats at the dock that morning and wore Che for the rest of the mission There was a striking Colombian woman who claimed the title  Princess of Cartagena  She was about 510slender with perfect ebony skin  She walked like a Colombian woman The Princess had her business partner too  They were both about 25 years old  A bunch of the kids were there contribution to the day  They recruit kids from poor neighborhoods with a convincing modeling agencyscheme throughout Central and South America The other two Colombians  Marcos and Hector  are Tims street guys  Theyre locals who were there to perform due diligence on Rauls operation and report it to Tim Another fact  Marcos and Hector are CTI agents Tim  fluent in Spanish  steered the conversation where it needed to go in order to make clear the intentions Raul and his partners It would be Pauls job to talk business while Tim got what he needed  So while Paul napkinned the business model  The Princess of Colombia laid down the ground rules for the man and child orgy that would commence upon arrival of the sizeable Cocaine order Princesss Rule Number One Several girls and one man is okay Several boys and one man is okay Boys and Girls and one man is still permissible But  several men on one girl or boy is not allowed Rule Number Two  The men must wear condoms When pressed on the condom issue  the Colombian men backed off with a wink  but the Princess stood by her ethics Those were the rules Tim hands  10 000 worth of Pesos to Paul  who shuffles them with his thumb  Raul  Fuego  and the other Colombian traffickers stared at the money  Paul informed them that since they seemed like stand up business people  the remaining  10 000 was on its way  It would be delivered when the party startedpresumably any minute Back in the bedroom  most of the kids laid around  Others made last second adjustments like shaving  One boy changed into a leopard speedo  They knew the drill and were trained to act the part The virgins were in a different room with their American handlers  Lady was crying  The little virgin boy  face buried in a pillow  asked if anyone had cocaine or alcohol  and explained that is what they usually gave him to prepare  Jen  a trained OUR operative and deadly Krav Daga fighter  comforted him  The American womens cover as preppers for the party  is standard procedure in such affairs  But these women were extensively trained in high stress environments  their shadow role was that of comforter to the kids In fact  each time the 11 year olds had their moments of nervous breakdown  a woman was their to comfort them  They all sat on a bed conversing with the American women  Chelsie  Krista  and Jen  The kids were nervous expressing it through a 14 year old translator who was learning English in Jr  High They tried to calm the girls with assurances that theyd be okay at the end of the day  Even with the assurances however  the kids had no inkling that freedom was closing in from about a mile away Chelsie  is actually Chelsie Hightower  7 season star of Americas Dancing with the Stars  She laid with her arm around one of the little girls and stroked her hair  Youre a good girl she told her Krista  who is an RN  Crossfit gym owner  and young mother  tried to help the kids see a vision of life outside of this current hell Jen walked among the older kids  kept in an adjacent room  asking about their lives  all while knowing something about them that they did not know themselves  There lives were about to radically change Heres another helpful fact Fact Five  a 30 man Colombian SWATTeam had established a 300 yard perimeter around the property  Another two boats were rapidly approaching the sand carrying 30 Colombian Army soldiers with guns drawn  C T I  The Colombian FBI equivalent  had replaced all of the waiters at the house and had even been on the three boats that dropped them off  Another boat full of Colombian social service and child psychologists was on its way as well The American I C E  Attach  Fernando  stood by in Cartagena should any American support be requested  His passion for the cause is another glimmer of hope in the kids favor of which they are unaware  Tim and Fernando had worked on cases together for years The entire beach house was wired with mics and hidden cameras  all warranted by the Colombian government and admissible as evidence in court In the dining area  the sex hotel negotiations dragged on as Paul drug Raul and The Princess through the deal points yet again Raul  completely unaware of the approaching convoy  left the table momentarily and interrupted the girlspreparation  to show the virgins to Paul  Tim left with him When he reached their room  Lady was still crying Wipe your tears Raul told her  and smile  She did Tim suggested that maybe Lady could sit this one out  She was clearly petrified Tims suggestion made Raul more determined and tension in the room rose Raul pulled Lady outside to see Paul  Her hands continued to shake as she sniffed  played with her long braids  and wiped her eyes In the dining area  she stood in front of Paul  The little boy was next to her Shes okay Raul eyes her seriously  Shes just excited Fine Paul waved them back to the room After the kids left  they got right back to business  Seemingly inspired by Ladys beauty  Paul made a proposition Why not  5000 for the virgins at our hotel he asked Raul  People would pay it Oh yes  Jefe Raul nodded as he spoke There were other things that Raul was unaware of as well  like the fact that Tim Ballards sex parties always ended the same wayand that at Tims instruction  Paul had been stalling now for 30 minutes for operations to get in place In fact  Paul  both of Tims Colombian street guys  Jens husband Joe  also a deadly Krav Daga expert  and Jimi  a former Marine and the current Crossfit national brand manager  and everyone else on the island except for the 6 of the Colombian traffickers had already rehearsed this scenario  They had trained extensively for it And now  it was go time Bring in the Vino Tim shouted to the waiters with a smile Army boats hit the beach about 100 yards away  Thirty armed agents leaped out of the boat and stormed the compound Bajar en la planta they shouted Raul ran toward the beach and forrest Paul ran  Tim ran  Everybody scattered Raul was heading down the beach when Tim  still in character  grabbed his shirt and forced him to turn around He ran with Raul  as if he knew a better escape route  right into the waiting arms of the several hidden CTI agents who were huddled at the doorway of the kitchen Soon  all of the Colombians and Americans were on the ground  legs and arms spread  faces in the dirt The Princess of Cartagena had collapsed on the table and audibly wept  Fuego hit the ground with a scowl  The drug guy tried to crawl under the table  but the bench was in his way Who the hell called the cops  I knew you were a traitorRaul  Tim yelled from the ground The groups were separated according to the plan laid out by the head of CTI  24 hours prior  Colombian Child Protective services entered where the kids were sequestered and the American girls were taken out to join the rest of the team face down on the beacharrested The roll of the women in the mission was to keep an eye on the children and make sure that they were okay until the arrival of the local authorities  at which point they have a scripted exit Flashback  Days earlier  realizing that his time under cover was growing short  and that this would likely be his last time face to face with an operation  Tim lamented  I hate that I always leave being the bad guy to the kids  I would love them just once to know that were the good guys  That we were here to free them After several minutes  Raul and his team were escorted off the island by a Navy boat  Tims jump team  called Operation Underground Railroad  wiped the sand off of their faces and embraced  They were careful not to let the kids see them celebrate  as it safer to maintain cover  but it was too late this time  Several of the girls had emerged and learned that Raul  Fuego  The Princess  her partner  and the cocaine guy were being arrested Inside of the room  an accidental breach of protocol  a Child Protective Services agent explained to a confused child  pointing at the women and the OUR team  Those ones are the good guys  Word spread and the kids began to wander out of the room  Some asked for the restroom  only so they could come out and smile and wave at the team Child Protective Services quickly pulled the kids back inside the room and the jump team of Americans was ushered to the boats but Child Protective Services forgot something  the window Walking back to the boat  the American girls passed the screened window where the youngest kids were sitting  An 11 year old came and pressed her hand to the screenothers came too The women and girls whispered back on forth  Smiling Tim approached behind the American women and was granted the one thing hed always wanted One little girl kept her hand on the window and he reached out to touch it  Tears flowed down her cheeksTims too  She probably didnt realize the personal price Tim had paid to get her back home  and back into the fifth grade unraped She is freeand so are her friends As the Operation Underground Railroad team boarded their getaway boats a noise rose from the house  Kids laughing  But with the revving engines  the noise changedinto kids cheering Note from the Author I was three feet from him when Tim met the little girl at the window  I had a camera in each hand  My instinct was to shoot  but something told me to keep it at my side So I did Front page image via Mark Mabry  ,0
Glenn hasnt been known to get involved in local sheriff elections  especially ones involving two Democrats  but on radio this morning  Glenn spoke to Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke about the backlash he has received because of his pro gun  pro Second Amendment beliefs I dont think ever we have ever gotten involved in a county sheriffs race  but there is one that you really need to know about that is happening today  Its happening in Milwaukee  Glenn said  This guy you have seen before Hes a Democrat  but hes common sense He is one of the few that will actually get out and say the truth  especially when it comes to guns  Thats why Michael Bloomberg is pouring money into this race Clarke assumed the sheriffs position in 2002 after being appointed to the vacant role by then governor Scott McCallum  Clarke has since won three elections  Clarke is up for reelection in November  and he is running as a Democrat  He faces a primary challenger in police lieutenant Chris Moews While he has easily run reelection in the past  Clarke currently faces a media blitz from the likes of former New York City mayor Michael Bloombergs Independence USA super PAC  which has dumped  150 000 into TV ads attacking Clarkes constitutionally based  pro gun stance   To put that figure in perspective  Fox News reports Bloombergs  150 000 is more than what Clarke and Moews have spent on their campaigns  combined   Theres a big push by the left leaning side of this party to get me out of here  Clarke told Glenn this morning  Its for one reason  Its because of my position on the Second Amendment in support of that  Im a constitutional sheriff  Its my position on encouraging people to play a role in their own safety You may recall the controversial public service announcement Clarke released last year encouraging residents to take a more proactive role in their own safety following budget cuts in the county   I tell people  You have a duty to protect yourself and your family  Ive turned citizens into my partner in beating back crime by playing a more prominent role in it  Clarke explained  Glenn  you know  the first line of defense against crime is not the police  Its always been the law abiding citizens  This is a message Ive carried throughout this county It is this message that Clarke believes has the hard liners on the left up in arms  The common sense message of personal safety  that Clarke believes is resonating in the community  is what has the left so driven to defeat the incumbent sheriff   Clarke explained he is currently working with a depleted police force because of furloughs mandated by the mayors office   The mayor here has furloughed Milwaukee police officers  all 1700  three days each  He has not filled the vacancies that have been created over the last couple of years  Clarke said  This is what average law abiding citizens are up against  And I just got tired having to see them sit by while these government controlled politicians here tell people  Just call 911 and wait The Democratic primary in Milwaukee is happening today  and it is an open primary  This means registered Republicans can vote in the election  and former governor Tommy Thompson is actually encouraging Milwaukee Republicans to vote for Clarke on Tuesday   In Wisconsin  we have an open primary  Im happy to have anybodys vote  I dont care what your religious affiliation is  I dont care what your ethnic background is  I dont care what your economic status is  Clarke concluded  Its been a patchwork of people who kind of get what Im talking about and say  Well  that transcends my party affiliation  That transcends all this other nonsense that gets in the way You can learn more about Clarkes campaign HERE   ,0
The Middle East is on fire  Israel and Hamas continue to trade rocket fire  while ISIS is on the march in Iraq  With a caliphate officially declared and a leader named  Glenn explained on Wednesdays Glenn Beck Program that he believes the coming weeks and months will see a further devolution of the situation that ignites a Sunni Shia war  That war will stretch from Pakistan all the way to Spain  and the implications will be global There are no happy endings  Glenn said somberly When you consider the bloodshed and sacrifice the United States has already endured in the region  it is troubling to think it could all be for nought  How can we possibly sit by and watch our sacrifice get flushed down the toilet  At the same time  how can we possibly believe another dollar or another life can solve this problem As he has discussed before  Glenn believes it is time for the American people to come together and courageously declare  Not one more  No more money  No more bloodshed Non interventionist is not only best course of action but the only course of action  Glenn said Instead  it is time to chart a new course  and Glenn said he is willing to give anyone who has a solution as to how best to deal with this turmoil a platform from which to share those ideas Later in the program  TheBlazes national security editor Buck Sexton was joined by American Enterprise Institute scholar Michael Rubin to war game the possible outcomes in Iraq and the Middle East more generally In this Red Cell  Iraq  Buck and Rubin looked at five possible scenarios and the regional and global implications of each  For those unfamiliar with the term  a Red Cell is a wargaming exercise that looks specifically at high impact  low probability scenarios  things that could happen and  if they did happen  would really make a big impact Below are the five possible outcomes that were discussed 1  Baghdad falls to ISIS Both Rubin and Buck agreed this is the worst case scenario for both the Middle East and the West  Iran would inevitably get involved  and the entire region would  as Rubin described  be set alight 2  ISIS sets up training camps and government apparatus While the caliphate has been declared  it is not a formal state  ISIS has  however  already begun distributing passports and other documentation to residents of the Syrian and Iraqi regions under its control  Rubin believes further formalization will only increase the likelihood of a terrorist attack in the West  for the root ofterrorist activity is not born of oppression but an unmitigated desire for conformity 3  ISIS conducts external terror attack against the West Despite the United States weariness ofwar  especially another war in the Middle East  a terrorist attack on U S  soil would undoubtedly lead to military intervention because the terrorists can more easily metastasize when the western forces are not in their way  As Rubin explained  without troops on the ground  thereis much lessactionable intelligence available 4  Jordan falls ISIS is already on Jordanian borders  and should the monarchy fall  the balance of power in the Middle East will be fundamentally redrawn in a way the world has not seen since World War II  Rubin believes that if Jordan fall  not only will Israel lose one of the few buffers it enjoys  but Saudi Arabia will likely face a similar threat 5  Emergence of Kurdish state The emergence of a Kurdish state in Iraq may very well be thebest scenario for the West  While the Turks typically oppose Kurdish statehood  for fear their own Kurd population will revolt  the country has given its blessing  to some extent  to theIraqi Kurds  Iran  however  will not be as welcoming of such a state  The Iranians have condemned and will continue to condemn such statehood for the minority group for reasons similar to Turkey ,0
If you are a regular listener  you are very familiar with the plight of the Pelletier family as they have spent over a year trying to regain custody of their 16 year old daughter Justina  The Massachusetts Department of Children and Families took custody of Justina in February 2013 after her parents disputed the diagnosis doctors at Boston Childrens Hospitals handed down  Boston Childrens Hospital said the then 15 year old had a psychiatric disorder  not mitochondrial disease  which her parents had been treating her for at the direction of another doctor Glenn has warned that whether it be through Common Core or medical laws  progressives are looking to take parents out of the equation whenever and whereverpossible  A new report out of Michigan seems to corroborate fears that states are taking steps to alienate parents from their childrens medical care On radio this morning  Glenn reacted to a fiery blog posted by Michigan mother Christy Duffy  who recently took her 17 year old daughter to a local hospital only to see a notice posted alerting parents that a nurse will need to have a short 5 minute private conversation with children ages 12 to 17 Duffy recounted her experience in a post on her blog on Monday I was there last week for an appointment for Amy  She hurt her foot  which makes dancing difficult  so we had to get that checked out  Amy is 17  I asked if this policy was in effect and if so  how could I opt out  The receptionist told me its a new law and there is no opting out  Working to keep my cool  I said  Im sure there is  She said  No  there isnt  At which point I asked if I needed to leave and go to the urgent care center because I was not submitting my daughter to such a conversation That did not go over well The receptionist closed the window  Almost immediately  the office manager turned the corner and said  Mrs  Duffy  may I speak with you She said there was a new policy that would allow a child to access his her medical records online and the child would be allowed to block a parent from viewing the website  The nurse would also inform my children that the doctors office is a safe place for them to receive information about STDs  HIV and birth control  That is what the nurse would be chatting about with my children without any pesky parental oversight Read the full blog post HERE Below is a photo of the sign Duffy was greeted with that has since been taken down Photo Credit  Christy Duffy As TheBlaze reported  in a follow up blog posted on Tuesday  Duffy explained that a woman in the hospitals privacy department contacted her  The woman apparently informed Duffy that Michigan law requires a minor be given the ability to deny his or her parents access to the online portion of his or her medical records The representative did say  however  that the hospital jumped the gun in posting the sign because its not clear how the policy will be implemented yet  Furthermore  the private conversation between a minor and a nurse is apparently not required by law Duffy  however  was not satisfied with that explanation They will attempt to separate a child from her parent at an appointment  They just dont know when  she wrote  I have nothing to hide  I do not abuse my children  But thats not the point  The point is that parents rights are eroding right in front of our eyes As Glenn concluded  the only way to stop this violation of parental rights is to take a stand as this mother has We will not conform  Glenn concluded  This is Justina Pelletier now going all across the country ,0
Earlier this week  TheBlaze reported armed federal agents had been deployed to northeast Clark County  Nevada after a decades long standoff between a local cattle rancher  Cliven Bundy  and the United States government  Bundy  who has likened the situation to historical confrontations like Ruby Ridge and Waco  Texas  is the last remaining rancher in the southern Nevada county  He currently stands in defiance of a 2013 court order demanding he remove his cattle from public land managed by the U S  Department of the Interiors Bureau of Land Management As the BLM and National Park Service agents moved into the area last week to remove the cattle  they simultaneously closed the Gold Butte area to the public  instead instituting First Amendment zones for protesters to gather  Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval said he was disturbed by the First Amendment zone because it tramples upon Nevadans fundamental rights under the U S  Constitution In Wednesdays morning meeting with his producers  Glenn explained why he feared this case was yet another example of the federal government waging a war against ranchers and farmers in  But as more details have emerged  it is harder to decipher who is right and who is wrong As it turns out  Bundy does not own the land  which is near his 150 acre ranch  and has not paid grazing fees since 1993  Bundy says he does not recognize the federal governments claim to the property but believes he is entitled to use the land for grazing because his family has done exactly that for decades  even before the BLM was formed TheBlazes Becket Adams reported The governments move to assert itself in the Gold Butte area shouldnt come as too much of a surprise considering the fact that its a move years in the making  In fact  the tense relationship between Bundy and federal government dates back to well before the 2013 court order The fight began when Bundy stopped paying the Bureau of Land Managements grazing fees in 1993  arguing in court filings that he had no obligation to pay the agency because his Mormon ancestors had worked the land decades before the agency was formed Bundy claims he owes roughly  300 000 in back fees  but the federal government says its more than that The land was finally declared off limits for cattle in 1998 and became a designated habitat for the federally protected desert tortoise  That same year  a judge ordered Bundy to remove his cattle  He refused to comply The situation escalated on Wednesday when protesters confronted the federal agents  Bundys son was hit with a stun gun during the incident  and his daughter was pushed to the ground  Another woman claims federal officials struck her with their vehicle Pat and Stu filled in for Glenn on radio this morning and sought to make sense of it all  As the situation has evolved this week  both Pat and Stu have found themselves with mixed feelings  While it initially seemed as though this was yet another example of the out of control government running amuck  there are also obvious issues with Bundy refusing to pay the grazing fees all these years and defying federal law ,0
Did you know Americans spend 23 hours a week on social networks  Thats almost a full day absorbing all the stupidity thats posted on Facebook  Twitter  Instagram  Pinterest  Pinstagram  Facetrest  Theres only one conclusion as to why we tolerate this behavior  Americans must be masochists  And those who want their pain alleviated write to me  When you see something stupid on social networks send it to Stu and hell get Anti Social Today  we look at the gun debate  And if theres anything Americans can agree on  its that we dont want to get our advice on guns from A  an English talent show host or b  a pop star who puts whipped cream on her boobs Lets start off with Katys tweet  She was reacting to a recent shooting at a mall Of course  gun control advocate Piers Morgan had an answer for Katy Did it work  No  Weird Afterwards Piers invited Katy Perry on his show and it doesnt seem like Katy actually responded  Thats like high school when youre talking to a pretty girl about something you miraculously have in common and then you say Hey  lets hang out and talk about it some more and she says Noooo  Thats been Piers entire life Look we all know that Piers is an anti gun fanatic  And Katy Perry routinely finds out that thinking is hard  but her motivations are good  She doesnt like tragedy like I dont like tragedy  Hey  we have something in common  Katy  maybe we should go out The point is  people like Katy and Piers tell us all the time that we have to do something about guns before another shooting happens  The specific shooting theyre talking about is the shooting in Maryland that happened a couple weeks ago that left 3 people dead  including the shooter  The shooter  a 19 year old man  killed two mall employees and himself  Extremely sad and tragic  but what do we do Here are the facts  The shooter purchased the gun legally from a gun shop in Rockville  MS  You may notice I said legally and didnt say gun show  He legally purchased the gun even though Maryland passed sweeping new restrictions on gun ownership  including a ban on new purchases of assault weapons and a 10 round limit on magazines just last year  The shooter hadnt previously owned a gun before and had no criminal record  Friends and family regarded the shooter as a nice  quiet young man  He had no issue with mental illness One other thing  there are no elected officials in the entire United States who are proposing a ban to the gun that he used  In fact  lots of people are telling you to buy that gun  a shotgun Why does Vice President Joe Biden heart shotguns so much  Maybe because shotguns provide safety to many families and are involved in less deaths per year than clubs and hammers  swimming pools  and falling out of bed deaths But even if you want to ban every single gun on the planet you still have to deal with this  at the crime scene police found and disabled two crude devices that appeared to be an attempt at making explosives using firework  The bottom line is this guy had made his mind up to hurt as many people as he could  Ban the gun  he would have used the bomb  Yet if you follow the wrong person on Twitter youre going to believe were in the midst of a mass shooting epidemic that can only be stopped by the iron fists of the government  And news sources back this stuff up There are 300 million guns in America  While 10 extra shootings isnt exactly a big percentage  its still ten too many  There are other issues with this report  but even if its true that more shootings are happening at schools  its important to ask why If you look at this chart  you can clearly see that there is no upward trend in mass shootings for the past 35 years  In fact the high point for mass shootings in America was actually 1929 So theres no increase in mass shootings  but news outlets tell us there is an increase in shootings at schools  Why is that  Could it be that those mass shooters have decided to pick their targets more carefully  Could it be because schools are gun free zones and that whackos think they can do considerably more damage at these places   Let me propose something crazy for a second  If you want real change as Katy put it  maybe we stop telling the world were unarmed at all times Im not saying you have to arm teachers  Im not even saying you have to have armed security  Lets take baby steps  Lets just make it mildly confusing for the murderers  How about not alerting predators in advance that there is no danger on the premises  Our goal here is to keep the kids safe  right  What do we do when we want to keep our homes safe  Maybe you buy a gun  And if you really love the second amendment you might even put this sign on your lawn You might get an alarm system for your home  or if you have a dog you might want to put a Beware of dog sign on your lawn  Youre telling the world with these signs to that theres a reason not to come inside But why would anyone in their right mind put up one like this You might as well be saying Come on in It makes about as much sense as putting up a sign that say this Or this Youd never put any of these signs up  because doing so would be completely insane  Its like rolling out a red carpet for anyone trying to do you harm  Thats exactly what a gun free zone is So lets start with a little tiny baby steps  Even if you want to keep your school as a gun free zone  stop telling people its a gun free zone  Instead try something like this Or this Or maybe even this So to review 1  Gun free zones for kids   danger free zones for criminals 2  Doing something is never a good idea unless you know what that something is 3  Piers Morgans IQ is smaller than Katy Perrys bra size ,0
After an initial love affair  Glenn  Pat  and Stu have not been fans of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie for quite some time now  From immigration to gun control to climate change  the guys do not believe Christie is the conservative he claims to be  and this latest bridge scandal is just the icing on the cake  As Glenn sees it  Christie is a big government progressive  and he will not support his 2016 presidential efforts  Pat and Stu have taken similar stances on the topic   Given Christies current success in the polls  however  it will be interesting to see how the next couple of years unfold  If the 2016 election were a fight between Republican candidate Chris Christie and  say  Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton  would Glenn  Pat  and Stu support the Republican  or would they vote third party   On radio this morning  Judy  a self described longtime listener from North Carolina  called in to discuss the potential danger of not keeping the Republican Party unified to defeat a Democratic challenger   The conversation that ensued was heated  but it represents a very real problem within the Republican Party  Are those who do will not support the chosen candidate poisoning the well as Judy argued  or are conservatives and small government minded individuals simply standing their ground  Check out Glenns conversation with Judy in the clip below and be sure to share your thoughts on the discussion board ,0
On radio this morning  Glenn ripped into former Florida Governor Jeb Bush for the remarks he made in an interview with ABC News over the weekend about Senator Ted Cruz  R TX  lacking self restraint in his fight to defund Obamacare All right  So  we have Jeb Bush advising us now on what should be done  And what should be done is  well  we never hear the alternative  Glenn said  Could we please play the Jeb Bush audio again because think this is really important to go over Interview begins around the 4 minute mark Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames JON KARL  Anything gained in all of this JEB BUSH  No  I think there was some ground lost from the political point of view JON KARL  And this started with Republicans  mostly in the House saying they wanted to gut Obamacare  and they were willing to not fund the government until that happened  I mean they changed a little bit as it went along  How badly are Republicans hurt by all of this  This started with their strategy JEB BUSH  Tactically  it was a mistake to focus on something that couldnt be achieved Since when have we become the party of things that cannot be achieved  Ive never been that person  Ive never been that person  And I never understood that person  Glenn said  We cannot achieve repealing a horrible  quoting the people who built it  train wreck  We cant achieve that  Since when cant we achieve that  Since weve become the party  and since weve become the people that are trained now to think that  Well  you can only do this  This is all you can get The repeal of Obamacare is not possible  But what is possible JON KARL  But I just spoke to Ted Cruz  He was the guy who said  Hey  lets not agree to a funding resolution unless Obamacare is defunded  That was the strategy that really kicked it off  And he told me that he will now do anything he can to stop Obamacare  and he does not rule out pushing to the brink once again  What would your message be to Ted Cruz JEB BUSH  Well  frankly  I think the best way to repeal Obamacare is to have an alternative  We never hear the alternative  We could do this at a much lower cost  with improved quality  based on our free market principles Wouldnt free market principles be repeal it  Free market principles would be to repeal it because his suggestion is  we can do this better  We  meaning the government  can do this better  Those arent free market principles  my man  Those are government principles  Those are socialist principles  Those are progressive principles  They are fascistic principles  They are communist principles and not free market principles  Glenn said  Hear that clearly  Thats who Jeb Bush is  It is not possible to not have the government involved in healthcare It hasnt even started  and you already are at a point where the government officials are all telling you  You cant do this without government  Weve been doing it without government the whole time and it was working out really well JEB BUSH  And two  show how Obamacare  flawed to its core  doesnt work  So  have a little bit of self restraint  It might actually be  politically  a better approach to see the massive dysfunction  But we dont even hear about that because weve stepped on that message  And I think Republicans need to just take a step back  show a little self restraint  and let this happen a little more organically Show a little self restraint  Show how it doesnt work  If you guys would not have been shooting at Ted Cruz  you could have been showing the world how bad it was  Glenn said exasperatedly  Now  why didnt you do that  If you wanted to show how bad it is  why wouldnt you do it  Because you want the framework  You want the control  Youve just announced that in the sentence before this where you said  We can do it better  We just have to reform it  You want control After laboring through this audio from Bush  Glenn had a message for the American people  Enough with the royal families Why do you have royal families  You have royal families because everybody knows they can trust them  The system knows they can trust them  Oh  okay  Well  I know your dad  And because I know your dad  I know what you are going to do  and you are not going off the beaten path because everybody in the family is in on this  Glenn explained  Why dont we just start calling them Lord Jeb and Lady Bush  the Duchesses of Houston  Why dont we call them that  The Kennedys and the Bushs  Enough with them  The Kennedys and the Bushs Stu made sure that he got one more family  that is more than likely gunning for a return to power in 2016  added to that list And the Clintons  Stu said ,0
It was twelve years ago people were inspired by the words lets roll  willing to undergo self sacrifice to help others  Today  people seem willing to just be cattle  The latest example  A Baltimore man was arrested for simply standing up and asking tough questions during a Common Core town hall meeting  Could this just be the latest step to government taking control of the American people  and using force and intimidation to suppress objections  Glenn thinks so  and he opened the show by explaining just what happened and what it all means Watch Below is a transcript of Glenns opening monologue If youve been watching my show for a long time  you are familiar with this  nudge  shove  shoot  and its how every Marxist utopian dream begins with just  it starts simple with just a little nudge  Its cash for clunkers  It is trying to figure out a way to make energy prices necessarily skyrocket  nudge you into hybrids or french fries versus carrots  you know  You put them in front of the chip so the kid eats healthy Then when this doesnt work anymore  then they have to start shoving  and thats when it gets more serious  Thats when they use the IRS to shut down the opposing voices  They use the NSA to monitor and track American citizens  They use labor intimidation  send the labor unions over to peoples houses  Then they start using regulation  and they start arresting people to scare everybody Eventually  that doesnt work anymore  because people want to be free  and they understand common sense  and they want to live in a world that makes sense to them  And so when this doesnt make sense  and this no longer works  if you really want your Marxist utopia  then it goes to this  and thats when you start shooting  You start shooting people or you send them to a reeducation camp or you send them to an internment camp It happens every time  and it happens when you forget about the individual  and you make it about the collective  It happens with every revolution  whether it is a revolution in the French Revolution or if it is a revolution in Egypt  So now where are we on the scale  Are we at nudge  shove  or shoot  Well  it really comes down to this  how do you transform a nation  How do you do it This is the list that I made about six years ago when I first started  maybe right before I started at Fox  I saw what was coming  and I thought okay  so if youre going to do fundamental transformation  what do you need  How do you do it  How do you take a nation thats free and do it  And I came up with a list of things you had to control You had to control the media  They had that one a long time ago  They control the media  They control the culture through Hollywood  Education  theyre putting the final nails on that  Theyve controlled it for a long time but not like theyre trying now  Banking  well they pretty much control everything  They control through the Fed your money  They control the value of what youve even saved Medical  theyve got that coming in the next couple of weeks  Communication  three little letters  NSA  they pretty much have that done  Food and farms  they are currently working on that like you wouldnt believe  Well show you in the next couple of weeks  Police  have you noticed how much money the Department of Homeland Security has put into your local police force  Have you noticed that the Department of Homeland Security is actually being used now as a local police force And the military  I never thought theyd get that one  That ones almost completely done  and of course labor  So they have all this done now  They didnt have all this done six years ago  They do now  And then they have to do one other thing  they have to use  exploit  or create an economic crisis  security fears  war  And when youre in war  you get to define who your enemies are  so you redefine the enemies Propaganda  we just had  our government just okayed  our Congress actually said its okay for our United States government now to do propaganda on our own people  Since when  Why did they need that piece  They have to use behavioral scientists  They have to figure out how to nudge and when to reeducate  Well  we know from The New York Times the president uses behavioral scientists  and nudge  shove  shoot  So where are we  Where are we Well  on Thursday  there was an event that happened that I found out about Friday night  and I couldnt sleep for two hours  because I believe it is a very important piece that moves us further towards shoot  It happened in Towson  Maryland  an upscale  or it used to be upscale suburb of Baltimore  A dad was arrested after a public forum  This is it  Common Core State Standards  This was the invitation  This was the flyer that went out It says here Your chance to get answers to your Common Core questions  Well  thats what it was  Dad stands up  and hes got a question about Common Core  His name is Robert Small  and he wasnt merely arrested  He was removed with excessive force and today  he faces ten years in prison By the way  this story is getting national coverage now  It hasnt received any local coverage yet  Now  if I told you that story  you would say theres got to be a catch  I want you to decide for yourself  because its all thank goodness captured on video But before I show it to you  heres what was going on  The school board decided that they instead of actually engaging with the parents in a back and forth question and answer session  that your questions  all the answers to your Common Core questions would need to be written down on paper and then handed in to the schoolmarm Now with this method  sure  maybe its a little more orderly  but it also removes the possibility of follow up questions on the spot  takes the microphone out of the crowd  takes the emotion out of the room  which I guess could be argued good thing or bad thing  But what happens is you suppress and minimize any possible objections Okay  so you could play that either way  You could be okay  well  theyre just trying to move things along  make sure people dont get longwinded  and make sure nobody gets angry  but then they screened and edited the questions in advance  So for over an hour  the crowd had to listen to the county superintendent talk about how wonderful Common Core was  Then they showed a video on how great Common Core is  Then they started reading some of the softball questions  and thats when Robert Small couldnt take it anymore  but he stood up in total self control  and heres what happened  Watch VIDEO  Robert Small  I went to Community College  I finished at the University of Maryland  And now I move my family out to Howard County because of the reputation the schools  My children are being prepared for community college  Youre not talking to them about which colleges  Youre not preparing them for Harvard Take control  Were sick of this  This is not a CNN political debate  This is a public town hall  Dont stand for this  Youre sitting here like cattle  You have questions  Confront them  They dont want to do it in public  Is this America  This is not a CNN political debate  Parents  you need to question these people  Do the research  Its online Look at this  Okay  now did he look at all out of control  That guy was intimidating him  He was manhandling him  This is the way it used to happen in mother Russia  not America  Now heres the kicker  The reason why I couldnt sleep on Friday is because this guy  the father  was charged with second degree assault of a police officer  faces a  2 500 fine and up to ten years in prison  Excuse me  Show me the physical threat  Show me the assault The assault happened the other way around as the officer was violently yanking him by his arm in an attempt to remove him  Remove him from what  What was his crime  asking a question about whats going to happen with his children  What law did this man break that warranted such a use of force  Ill tell you what it was  doing this  doing this  You know this picture  You know what that is Thats Norman Rockwell  a guy standing up in a school board meeting and speaking his mind  Thats what Norman Rockwell said was one of the four freedoms  stating your opinion  As Small was being dragged out  he said dont stand for this  Youre sitting here like cattle  Mr  Smalls admonition to the herd is spot on Where were the teachers as he was being removed  you know  the ones that always teach about its a wrong to bully people  Did no one feel that he was being bullied  Did not one person have the decency to say stop  stop  stop  Up there on the board  no one said lets himstop  One woman taping asked that question  Another woman stood up  said something to the guard to no avail  but other than that  nothing  nothing We have seen in the last few months teachers stand up for a colleague who sexually molested and raped an eighth grade student  but the teachers dont stand up against this  No one  none of the parents dare ask a question out loud or directly addressed the almighty school board without writing it down on paper first  otherwise it will turn into the Salem witch trials  Cattle  time to get out of the herd  because youre being led to slaughter Perhaps people were afraid to speak because they were afraid of being dragged off by a police officer  and so the option is I sit here with my mouth closed like cattle  And when nobody is there to stand up for you  its because you werent there to stand up for everybody else that was dragged off  I just want you to put this in perspective  It was 12 years ago  Were still the same Americans  Its not like some past generation  Were still the same generation that 12 years ago we were inspired by the rallying cry of the typical American that said lets roll Weve gone from lets roll to cattle in 12 years  Dont tell me that we havent lost our country  Dont tell me that we havent been fundamentally transformed  I dont even recognize Americans anymore  Now  heres why I want you to remember this video  I want you to write this down  If you keep a journal  I want you to write this down  because youre going to look like a prophet to your kids someday  Believe me on this Do you remember when I was at Fox and I told you about the fruit cart vendor in Tunisia that set himself on fire  And I said that guy  that  nobody will understand  and everybody will call me crazy  which they did  but that will lead to a watershed moment  and it will spread across the Middle East  and it will turn everything into chaos  And it did  Write it down in your journal  This is a watershed moment It doesnt matter if this guy goes to jail or not  Did people learn their lesson  Its dictatorship 101  make someone an example  and the rest will stay in line  The next meeting of that school district  they should have 10 000 people there  but I doubt they will  To quote Mr  Small  is this America  I dont know Now  I want to take you to the other big story that happened this weekend  but I want to make sure you couple it with this story  because remember  we started with that list of how do you take over a nation like this  This storys happening on the other side of the globe  It happened in Kenya  where at least 62 people are dead as terrorists have taken an upscale mall by violent and coordinated attack that targeted non Muslims Now  by the way  Kenya is a country that has all kinds of gun restrictions  cant have an automatic weapon  cant have a semi automatic weapon  You cant even have a handgun yourself  If you use a gun in self defense  youre in trouble  So what happens  The group responsible for this was an Al Qaeda affiliated group  you know  Al Qaeda  the one thats on the run that weve pretty much put out of business This group is called Al Shabaab  You need to know the name  Al Shabaab  They claim to be retaliating against what Muslims in Somalia experienced at the hands of Kenyon invaders  So when they went into this mall  they asked the shoppers what is the name of Muhammads mother  Sylvia isnt the right answer apparently  If you couldnt answer it  you got shot They tweeted the rampage live  Like it or loathe it  Our mujahideen confirmed all executions were point blank range  I loathe it  I dont know about you  So people will watch this  and theyll say how does this even affect me  I mean  were here in America  Well  heres how  One of the Twitter accounts used by the terrorists identified ten of the gunmen  Three of them  at least three they say  were Americans  two allegedly from Minneapolis  an area which is Al Shabaab They have actively recruited in Minneapolis  Now  U S  officials dont have any confirmation of Americans having been involved in the attacks as of yet  Theyre still working on it  Well focus on that angle tomorrow  but youre not going to believe who our government is inviting and moving into our country  and you wont believe the numbers that theyre doing it in This administration says they believe the U S  is not really a priority for Al Shabaab right now  Really  Thats not what For the Record tells us  Two weeks ago  For the Record  a new program  the 60 Minutes of our generation  mark my words  put that in your journal as well  they reported just two weeks ago that there was documented proof that Al Shabaab members had crossed oh  our unsecured Mexican border into the U S VIDEO  The Al Qaeda linked terrorist group Al Shabaab based in Somalia has attracted dozens of American recruits Sara Carter  Ive covered stories where we know Somalians were attempting to cross into the United States from the Mexican border that were connected to Al Shabaab  That was documented  The documents were right there  I was able to write the story  prove that there were terrorists connected to Al Shabaab trying to enter the United States from Mexico  The Mexican authorities had released them  and then they disappeared inside Mexico  And there was a scramble to try to find them Really  Are they coming here looking for some undocumented jobs  Is that what it is  We have an administration that has sided with radical Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood  who by the way were banned once again today in Egypt  while our own government is cozying up to the Brotherhood and turning a blind eye to dangerous extremists and making it easy  beyond making it easy  they are sending them here  Well tell you about that tomorrow In 2010  the president issued an executive order allowing 80 000 refugees to immigrate to the U S  So what happens when all hell breaks loose  What happens to us when  lets say  Al Shabaab members start shooting in our Westlake malls  and people plead for help  The top comes crashing down all too ready to help with all kinds of excuses that will be made to remove more freedoms from America  all of course in the name of safety And as the people in Baltimore demonstrated  even though people know its wrong  they wont do anything  Theyll sit like cattle  Anyone who disagrees and stands will be deemed an enemy of the state  a security risk  and will be shoved and eventually shot  I said at the beginning  this is happening in Egypt  This is current  Fifty five thousand unlicensed clerics were rounded up this weekend because they were deemed a threat to Egypt security  See  it happens this way every time If Egypt can round up that many people  I mean  do you think our government could doI mean  can you imagine what we could do in a weekend  And please dont start with me oh  yeah  hes crazy talking  Its never happened here  It already has happen  You need to go back and look at the images from the Japanese internment camps  All you need is a war  All you need is a threat  All you need is somebody at the top  and its always a Progressive that says round them up Oh  and in totally unrelated news that would make it easier for government to round people up  President Obama turned the naval yard memorial into a gun control speech  believe it or not  arguing that transformation was needed  Watch VIDEO  President Obama  These families have endured a shattering tragedy  It ought to be a shock to all of us as a nation and as a people  It ought to obsess us  It ought to lead to some sort of transformation And it will  Translation  We have to disarm more Americans  Watch the speech  Its outrageous  Disarm more Americans  all in the name of safety  of course  Let me ask the question that Ive asked a few times here  and I dont seem to get an answer to  We are arming Al Qaeda and the rebels in the Middle East  not just with guns but automatic weapons and rockets  and some of the rebels are from here in the U S  and yet at the same time  the same guy arming them is trying to disarm loyal American citizens The time to decide who you are and what you believe and whats worth standing for  fighting for  dying for  going to jail for  is not when youre sitting in a school district meeting  The time to decide who you are is right now  long before you have to make that decision ,0
In the ultimate display of denial  recalled Democratic Colorado State Senator Angela Giron blamed her loss on voter suppression during an appearance on CNN yesterday  Earlier this week  Colorado residents voted to recall Giron and Democratic Senate President John Morse over a number of gun control laws they pushed through the State Legislature GIRON  We know what really happened here  Yes  we had the strong NRA and you have a person like Mr  Head  but what this story is really about  its about voter suppression  When Colorado has voted by mail  70  of Coloradoans vote by mail  And we didnt have access to that mail ballot BROOKE BALDWIN  Okay  forgive me but Im going to cut you off right there because if we talk voter suppression  Ive read reports of lack of popularity on your behalf  Lets just not go there  Lets get to the meat of the story which is this gun control stance that they GIRON  That is the meat of it That is so great  Pat said  Lets not go there  Ive got reports of how unpopular you are  Can we not blame this on voter suppression  Because 5 6t of the money spent in this race was spent by  Giron  Morse  and their allies  the mayors against guns group  Its amazing The CNN anchor went on to remind Giron that nearly  3 5 million dollars was poured into her campaign efforts  including at  350 000 personal donation from New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg  Bloombergs organization  Mayors Against Illegal Guns  had promised to keep Giron and Morse in office  Comparatively  the National Rifle Associated donated  368 000 to support the recall effort  which pulled in only  500 000 total from the pro gun lobby I mean  that is incredible  Glenn concluded ,0
 Warning  Graphic language Progressives love to accuse conservatives of wanting not caring about or defending womens issues  The thing is  when it actually comes to defending an individual  progressives are no where to be found if it isnt a situation that fits their agenda  in fact  theyre often the aggressor against conservative women   Dana Loesch is often the receiving end of violent threats  harassment  and attacks from progressive men  Rarely are these individuals called out by their own side  Last night was just one more example   Progressive Huffington Post blogger Pascal Robert  known online as THOUGHT MERCHANT  launched a sexually graphic and despicable attack against conservative radio host and friend of TheBlaze Dana Loesch last night on Twitter   Why Simply because Dana has a different opinion that he does on Second Amendment rights   After tweeting an article from Politifact debunking an anti gun ad  Oh look  the Cougar Coalition for Gun Control's latest ad was rated bullshit  http t co Ybu9uciOcP  Dana Loesch  DLoesch  August 28  2013 Robert offered the following digesting  and unwanted  response DLoesch I know you would look lovely with thigh high stockings and would love to have a brother give to you up the ass  Wouldn't you  Pascal Robert  probert06  August 28  2013 Is this how the left is fighting their war on women  By essentially throwing around rape threats on Twitter  Where are all of the progressives who were up in arms after Sandra Fluke was referred to as a slut on radio   Not to mention  its hard not to point out the blatant irony of a progressive issuing violent threats against a woman while opposing her right to bear arms  Can you blame Dana for wanting the be able to defend herself when she receives tweets like this on a regular basis   Coincidence  Progressive men who regularly threaten conservative women with rape are also anti gun  Dana Loesch  DLoesch  August 28  2013 And more importantly  why is Huffington Post providing this type of individual with a public platform  Is this the kind of man they want representing the kind of individuals that they hire   How can somebody who writes for the Huffington Post get away with that  Glenn asked Well  he shouldnt  Pat answered  He shouldnt be writing for the Huffington Post anymore  Thats for sure I would fire somebody that would do that  If you were tweeting that to some woman that you disagreed with  Id fire you  Glenn added Pat promptly pointed out that if Glenn didnt fire someone who did that  hed be excoriatedby the Huffington Post Ironic Hardly  This is the hypocrisy weve come to expect from the progressive lefts do as I say  not as I do attitude   Not to say that no one came to Danas defense last night  some did  And because of it they were on the receiving end of this dirtbags vile tweets as well   You can see the entire exchange on Danas Storify page HERE   The double standards from the left when it comes to womens issues are unbelievable  But its exchanges like this that highlight how most of them couldnt care less about women at all  they only care about their agenda  If you have a public voice that can influence the opposing side  they want to isolate you so you dont speak out   Stu summed it up best this morning when he said  the problem is Dana  as a woman  is part of the war on women  shes leading the war on women pretty much  So I think its okay to them then  right Sadly  those are the standards the media goes by these days  But the new media  lead by individuals like Dana Loesch have no plans to sit down or shut up   Ladies  do not tolerate progressive males to threaten you into silence over your God given right to political diversity  Ever  Dana Loesch  DLoesch  August 28  2013 Its important to stand by the ones who are brave enough to keep speaking out   I appreciate you all who speak out against these morons  You show other women that if they take heat over free opinion  they have allies  Dana Loesch  DLoesch  August 28  2013 Watch Glenns response below ,0
This week  Buck Sexton  National Security Editor at TheBlaze and co host of Real News  has been traveling through the center of the bloodiest conflict on the globe  near the Jordanian Syrian border  On radio this morning  Buck called in from Cairo  Egypt to explain how bad the refugee camps are  what the outlook is  and what locals on the ground have to say about America   To start  Buck explained the situation in Egypt and the welcome  or lack there of  he has received in the country  I was in Tahrir  Square  just until a few minutes ago  I stepped away from it so I could get on a phone line where youd actually be able to hear me  And also as you can expect  they dont particularly like people who look like they may be Western journalists walking around them with cellphones  cellphone cameras  et cetera  he explained  They were very testy when I just spoke to them before  The whole city right now  Glenn  and this is in Cairo the whole citys on edge because of the one year anniversary of Muslim Brotherhoods Mohammed Morsi taking power  There are huge demonstrations going right now And people are very worried  theres a serious possibility  even by Cairo standards  for things to get out of control and there to be real violence The mainstream media has painted the uprisings in Egypt and the Arab Spring more generally as a revolutionary  pro democracy movement that Americans should enthusiastically support  As it turns out  the Arab Spring set the Middle East on fire  and now it seems those living in the region have found a scapegoat  the United States I thought there was a very Jeffersonian revolution  I heard that from Bill Kristol  Glenn joked  I thought this was going to be really a good thing Well  youll be happy to know  Glenn  that the Egyptians have already come up with a very plausible explanation for all this  which is that its Americas fault  Buck said  And Ive been told this now many times  So its not that they messed up the revolution  Its that somehow we messed up the revolution But on top of that the economy here is in such rough shape right now  I feel bad for these shopkeepers and these other guys who are trying to make a living for their families from tourism  but you know what  I mean  when the Muslim Brotherhoods running things and people are scared  they tend not to want to spend their vacation time  their vacation money worried as to whether they are going to get caught in a protest and catch a little teargas in the face Buck explained that  at this point  many in the country are just looking for someone to blame  and America is an easy target  One of the explanations Buck has heard involves the United States orchestrating the Muslim Brotherhoods rise to power and ruining the revolution In addition to being in Egypt  Buck visited Syrian refugee camps to better understand the breadth of the situation on the ground  What he found was staggering I spent an entire day with the refugees yesterday in Zaatari  which is the camp  Its only a few miles from the Syrian border  The nearest town gets hit with errant shells from Assads artillery  Buck said  And the stories  there are two things that really came out of my discussions there  One of them is just the level of violence and viciousness and evil that is going on in this conflict is well beyond what I think most people understand  People were absolutely terrified that I was going to take their photograph because theyre worried about repercussions either for themselves or their families if they try to go back or anyone whos still there  They were worried about me taking a photo  Glenn  that had water bottles in it  Now  I said why is that a concern  You know  I was taking a photo of something and they said that recently some Assad troops found a family of five that had just come sort of across the border and they said  oh  those water bottles  those must have come from the refugee camp  They lay them all down  they executed them all on the spot  including three small children  So the viciousness is impossible to overstate You could liken the situation to ethnic cleansing  but  as Buck explained  the situation is more like human cleansing   They are killing everybody they think is opposed to them  he said  And then  of course  youve got the guys with the beards in the camp who are clearly  shall we say not of the Jeffersonian model  and perhaps very obviously of the fundamentalist and even pro jihadist model  They wouldnt speak to me  They eyed me very warily and quite honestly there are a lot of fights and there have been some violence in the camp  So I had to watch out for that  They see me as the enemy  They made that very clear So what are the Syrian opposition forces looking for But they want guns  They dont want a no fly zone  They want guns  They want us to arm them  They want us to let them finish the job  They were very clear on that as well  Buck said   With the Obama administration publically proclaiming that the red line has been crossed and they are preparing to take action in Syria  the mindset seems to be that the U S  can somehow swoop in and end the fighting  But that is simply not the case No one is prepared for whats coming  There are so many more refugees  so much more violence  This thing is far from over  Buck explained  And the notion that we could end it  even if you wanted to  is kind of a fantasy  So it was eye opening  And these people are living in absolute squalor  by the way  I mean  the international community  forget the fact they cant stop the fight in Syria  They should be completely ashamed of themselves  They say this is what theyre supposed to be able to do is feed starving children  and they are not doing a very good job The last few days  Glenn has been open with his predictions that World War III may very well be on the horizon  And with border fights in the Middle East continuing and and international support varied  it seems difficult to avoid a global scaled conflict I dont think we can avoid a broader conflict really in the Middle East  Buck said  Look  youve already got Lebanon for all intents and purposes involved in this  Hezbollah has thrown their lot in  The Russians are backing Assad to the hilt  The fact that they will back this regime tells you all you need to know about the character of the Russian government or its complete lack of character  Its disgraceful  The Iranians have gone in full force on this issue  And the international communitys so slow to get involved But Glenn  I mean  this is the other side of it  Im giving you evils of the Assad regime  right  I was staring into the eyes of small children yesterday who  one kid looked at me  we were kicking around a soccer ball  and he said  They murdered my mother  they assassinated my brother  but my father is fighting for the Free Syrian Army  so everything will be okay  All right  Thats one side of this  he continued  The other side are the people that I spoke to in Jordan who are in contact with  know the resistance well  have been up and back across the border  They say that when it comes to the real fighting against the Syrian regime  against Assad forces  80  of the major combat effectiveness  not the numbers of people but the combat effectiveness comes from the jihadists  the hardliners  the guys who as soon as they can take control of Syria want to start raining hellfire into Israel right next door  The Israelis know this  Thats why everybodys on edge Ultimately  there is no easy answer Other than I wish these kids that I saw in the camp had food and were living in tents that were 120 degrees in the middle of the desert  I dont know what the answer is  Buck said  You got two sides  we cant trust either one  and if this thing goes cross border  and it very well could  into Turkey  into Jordan  you name it  no one knows  How do they stop the violence  I dont know   As much as the people in the Middle East blame America and have written off the U S  because of the Obama administrations incompetence  Glenn believes it will be a small group of strong willed individuals who will first save this country and then save the world If we have any chance of saving this country and the planet and mans freedom  it will come from a small group of people  and I believe it will come from the people who have brushed across this audience  Glenn said  Love is the answer  Peace  peaceful resistance   Standing in the fire of God  Because when everything else is burning  theres only one thing that wont  It will just become more pure  And if were not in that space  we will lose and the whole world will go the way of Europe  And strong men will return  Whether theyre religious strong men or just brutal thugs  strong men will return  It cant happen here  Cant  Were the only hope the world has ,0
Glenn talked about the latest Obama scandal  federal snooping that even Al Gore found obscene  during an interview with Ted Cruz on radio today Full transcript below GLENN  Heres Senator Ted Cruz  How are you  Senator CRUZ  Glenn  its always good to be with you GLENN  Its good to be with you  sir  Its an honor  I tell you  Ive said this several times on the air but I want to say it to your face  We thought you were really good  We supported  as you know  However  quite honestly  were like  is this guy going to be his dad  Is he going to be as good as his dad would be CRUZ  Well  now  thats setting an impossible bar there GLENN  No  I know that  No  I know that  And we wondered  We thought  is he really going to do what he says hes going to do  You are a blessing  sir  You  PAT  You have lived up to everything we expected and then some GLENN  I mean  we will  we will have to have you destroyed if you turn PAT  Of course GLENN  But it is  it is refreshing to see somebody actually go and do what they say theyre going to do  stand against all of the heat  And I think you have given a lot of people a lot of hope CRUZ  Well  thats a thank you  Glenn  I appreciate it  I appreciate the tremendous work you do every day  standing up and speaking the truth to power GLENN  Well  I have  CRUZ  When they dont like to hear it GLENN  Yeah CRUZ  And so  you know  from my end  I just feel fortunate to have the chance to try to serve and try and stand up and do the right thing  I find it curious why there are not 99 others doing exactly the same thing GLENN  Oh  I cant  with everything thats going on  I mean  the latest now is the NSA  The NSA just taking  you know  being  going to Verizon and saying  We want the records of people  These arent even  theyre not even terrorists  You dont even have to be apparently on a terrorist list anymore CRUZ  Right GLENN  That theyre just taking your phone records and everything else  And thats only one  Thats only Verizon  Millions of people  Americans  are being spied on right now by the government  and what do you thinks going to happen here CRUZ  Well  theres a pattern unfortunately of this administration not respecting the Bill of Rights and not respecting the Constitution  And weve seen over and over again their willingness to  I think they view the Constitution as essentially a pesky obstruction to carrying out their agenda  So whether it is the First Amendment  going after journalists and media and seizing their phone records and emails  or trying to take away the right of servicemen and women to share their faith  or whether its the Second Amendment  stripping away our right to keep and bear arms  or whether its the Fourth and Fifth Amendment  either with drone policy targeting Americans or with the NSA not respecting our rights of privacy and conducting unreasonable searches and seizures  or with the IRS targeting those they perceive to be their political enemies  It is a very troubling pattern and it is one that I think every American  conservative or liberal  should be concerned when the federal government arrogates to itself so much power that it admits no limits under the Bill of Rights and Constitution GLENN  So we were just having this conversation because the IRS is in contempt  I mean  they have missed now two deadlines  I dont know why we dont padlock their doors  quite honestly  and do to them everything that they do to the American people  But theyre not in compliance now with congress  They are arrogant  everybody just keeps getting more promotions  nobody  nobody seems to be afraid of anything in Washington anymore  And Pat and I were talking and said will the American people  with the NSA and the IRS and everything else  will they finally say enough is enough  And he brought up a really good point  and I want to ask you this question  He said  how does anybody say enough anymore  We had our opportunity at the election and how are you going to say enough  What is it that  what is it that the American people can do now  Isnt it too late CRUZ  Well  you know  theres quite a bit we can do  I mean  I understand the frustration  and there are certainly consequences to elections  And one of the consequences is that we are going to have to deal with people in office who are abusing their power  But the American people can nonetheless stand up  You know  if you look at the last six months  I found it very encouraging  We have seen in the U S  Senate a small band of committed conservatives beginning to stand up  to stand and fight  And what has happened is that grassroots conservatives all over the country have rallied to stand for principle and that has been able to move the Senate and to win the fights You know  if you think back to the fight over drones  when I was proud to be standing shoulder to shoulder with Rand Paul filibustering for 13 hours  that was viewed as a fringe issue  as a quixotic issue  and yet millions of Americans engaged  spoke up  got online  And in those 13 hours  the Obama administration was forced to what it had refused to do for three straight weeks  which is admit that the Constitution limits their power to target Americans Just so on guns  You know  when the tragic murder occurred up in Newtown and this administration shamelessly began trying to exploit that horrific crime  not to target criminals  not to go after bad guys but to restrict the constitutional liberties  the right to keep and bear arms of lawabiding citizens Ive got to tell you in Washington the sense was that was unstoppable  This was a freight train that could not be stopped  and what happened was incredible  Again  a small band of conservatives initially stood up  and grassroots activists all over the country rose up  called their senators  called their representatives  And when it came to the floor of the Senate  every single proposal that would have undermined the Second Amendment was voted down  and it was voted down because the American people spoke up and spoke up loudly GLENN  Okay  The IRS  The IRS is completely out of control  and I said on the air yesterday  and by the way  I mean  between you and Rand Paul  I feel like Im cheating on one when Im speaking to the other because I just  I would  I mean  the throwdown could happen at any moment with the two of you  Im in so much love with you  But with the IRS  CRUZ  You know what  We are all fighting for the same mistress GLENN  I know  I know  Now heres the thing  With the IRS  when you came out and I saw this ad on our network and it was abolish the IRS  I think it was abolishtheIRS com or something like that  And I saw that and I said  the best thing that has ever happened in my life  Wife  children  whatever  Ted Cruz being elected  How  as I said on the air yesterday  this is the opportunity to abolish the IRS PAT  Yeah GLENN  It really is  How do we do it CRUZ  Well  Glenn  let me first step up and try and protect you and say for the record that you didnt mean that GLENN   Laughing CRUZ  Im really trying to protect the  inaudible Look  This is an opportunity for the American people to understand that too much power in Washington is fundamentally a threat to our liberty  and the best solution  look  the IRS  we discovered it believed it had the power to demand from ordinary citizens  number one  what books are you reading  Prepare book reports on the specific books youre reading  We learned from other citizens it demanded to know  tell us the content of your prayers  What are you praying for  You know  you cant make this stuff up  And you and I both know the federal government has no business and no constitutional authority at all to inquire of any American the content of our prayers  And fundamentally this is about too much power in Washington  The best solution is padlock the whole place  Shut it down and move to a simple flat tax  Every American I think should be able to fill out their taxes on a postcard  And in addition to limiting that outofcontrol power in Washington  it would also have enormous positive effects on the economy You know  every year we spend  500 billion on tax compliance that is totally wasted  Far better to have that going to economic growth and new jobs GLENN  So again  how do we do  what would help you get that done  Do you need people with flat tax signs surrounding the capitol  What is it that would get that moving CRUZ  What I would encourage people to do is to sign up  speak out  and join the effort to spread the momentum  So I would urge folks  come to my website  which is TedCruz org  Sign up online there  Weve got a petition to abolish the IRS right on the front page of TedCruz org  I would urge everyone listening  sign that petition  Number two  GLENN  I am signing right now CRUZ   spread it to your friends  You know  there are links right on there to share it on Facebook  to share it on Twitter  to send emails about it  Build the momentum and spread the word  The more people that come together and speak out  the more momentum we have to get peoples attention PAT  Senator  do you really think its  I mean  is it possible  Because its always seemed like  I mean  the fair tax people talk about abolishing the IRS all the time and you say  blah  blahblah  its not going to happen  Is it  do we actually have a real opportunity here if we move forward on this CRUZ  It depends  I mean  if youre asking do we have the votes today on the floor of the Senate to abolish the IRS  The answers no PAT  Yeah  No CRUZ  We dont have the votes today GLENN  But wait a minute  This is the beginning  Weve been talking about this CRUZ  Right GLENN  This is the beginning of Watergate  I mean  PAT  It will take time GLENN  It will take time but in two years  PAT  It could spread fast GLENN  It could spread really fast  You couple the NSA  healthcare  and the IRS  Americans will say  CRUZ  Yep GLENN   Youre not collecting anything from me  I dont want anything  I dont want to give you any information  Ill tell you this is what I made  subtract 15  there it is  get out of my face CRUZ  Yeah  And as you know  the person who was in charge of persecuting conservative groups is now put in charge of ObamaCare GLENN  I know CRUZ  Is now the lead enforcer for our healthcare system  They are developing the largest database the government has ever assembled on the American citizenry  And that  you know  so the question is can this be done  As I said  we dont have the votes today  but if enough people sign up on the petition  if enough people speak out  if we start to get hundreds of thousands and then millions of people speaking out  writing oped columns  writing Facebook columns and then focused on calling their senators and their members of congress  Ive got to tell you  elected officials pay attention when the citizens speak up  It gets their attention  How did we win the gunfight  The number one way we won the gunfight is hundreds of thousands of people began lighting up the phone of senators  and those senators who were wobbling  who were on the edge suddenly started saying  I got how many calls  And it was amazing how when the people speak up  spinal fortitude can be increased GLENN  Okay  So let me switch to another topic here  another extraordinarily dangerous person  Samantha Powers  Most people in congress and in the Senate have absolutely no idea who Cass Sunstein even is or that Cass Sunstein  what youre seeing in the IRS I am absolutely convinced is Cass Sunsteins work  It is the way he operates  He knows  he knows what the law is and the regulations  and he floods you with paperwork  He floods  all that was happening with the IRS was a targeting and a nudge  Nudge them  keep nudging and then a little  maybe a little bit  put a little shoulder into that  Kind of shove them a little bit  But thats all that is  Thats Cass Sunstein  His wife is wildly  wildly antiIsrael  and shes now been named  Samantha Powers  shes now been named as the nominee for the ambassador at the UN  Shes a dangerous woman  Shes the one who was the architect behind Libya CRUZ  Glenn  I think youre exactly right  I think the nomination of Samantha Power is deeply  deeply troubling  It follows a pattern of this administration  particularly in the second term  They seem to be seeking out in the foreign policy arena people who have been radicals  people who have been extreme  who have been far outside the mainstream  You know  she has publicly written  for example  you and I both were quite vocal criticizing the president the for beginning his first term by going on a worldwide apology tour  by going to tyrants and despots and apologizing for the United States Whats amazing is Samantha Power has tubally not only embraced her view that America needs to keep apologizing  she has gone so far as to explicitly urge  quote  instituting a doctrine of the mea culpa  which as you know is Latin for basically groveling and saying Im sorry  Im sorry  Im sorry  You know  Glenn  no nation in the history of the world has spilled more blood  has sacrificed more for the freedom of others than the United States of America  and I dont understand what it is with these leftwing academics where they are compelled to constantly grovel  you know  before tyrants like Castro and Cuba and North Korea about apparently their embarrassment about the United States  She has been strongly critical of our support of Israel GLENN  Oh  yeah CRUZ  Like many academics GLENN  No  she  CRUZ  She is a hardcore interventionist and  in fact  she believes we should send our men and women into harms way for whatever causes she deems humanitarian  Mind you not or our national security interest but  PAT  Including protecting Palestine against Israel GLENN  Right  She wants a  PAT  Amazing GLENN   force to stand there and protect the Palestinians against Israel PAT  Amazing CRUZ  That is exactly right  And let me just read a quote from her which I wish this were on video and not radio because it would be fun to see your head explode  Heres the quote  Quote  We have to believe in international law and binding ourself to international standards in the interest of getting others bound to those standards PAT  Wow GLENN  Yeah  No  I dont think so PAT  Wow GLENN  There goes my head  Ted  Ive got to  Ive got a network break I have to take  but I would love to have you on again  You are doing Gods work and I thank you so much  Please  please remain humble and please  I beg of you  say your prayers on your knees every night  Please remain humble and know who youre in the service of and its  CRUZ  Well  thank you  Glenn  All of us have much cause to seek God in prayer and were all standing up trying to save our country  and Im certainly honored to have the chance to serve with so many millions of Americans who are praying and standing for this nation GLENN  Well talk to you again  Thanks  senator CRUZ  Thank you  Glenn GLENN  Senator Ted Cruz  one of the absolute heroes of our day  I believe  Pray protection on him that he doesnt lose his soul ,0
Many fans will remember Cody Wilson as one of the most interesting guests that Glenn has had on the show in a long time  Wilson has pioneered the effort to make 3D printed guns and to widely distribute those files on the internet for free  In doing so  he threatens to disrupt the very idea of gun control because 3D printers are rapidly approaching a price where they could be purchased by the average consumer  Well  since his first appearance on the program Wilson has managed to successfully print and fire the gun  He opened up to Glenn about what that has meant for him as he faces legal challenges and finds himself on the forefront of history Part 1 Part 2 ,0
Alright  lets talk about this weekend  because it really was the tale of two weekends  One group gathered in Houston  Texas  men and women who understand the times in which we live  that liberty comes with responsibility  that without liberty there is tyranny  the time is now if not passed  to stand  They get it  Government is part of the problem  I mean  were part of the problem  but its certainly not the solution And then there were those gathered to say exactly the opposite  that the American people are the problem  and government is the solution  First  let me take you to a university where the president was speaking  Notice hell always speak to university students  He is reaching right directly for the youth of the world President Obama said Mexicos gang violence is because of our addiction  the U S  citizens drug addictions  not Mexican cartels  no  no  no  Watch VIDEO  President Obama  We understand that much of the root cause of violence thats been happening here in Mexico for which so many Mexicans have suffered is the demand for illegal drugs in the United States  And we also recognize that most of the guns used to commit violence here in Mexico come from the United States Do you hear what he has done  What he has donemost of the guns that kill Mexicans  he is setting us up  He is setting us up  When we are weak  they will pile across the border  because the president has even verified its your fault  Its your fault  There was no mention of Fast and Furious  Theyll be no questioning of the DOJ officials responsible for trafficking guns over the border  guns that were later used by criminals to kill U S  border agent Brian Terry and over 300 others in Mexico To date  no one in the DOJ has gone to jail for this number  Nobodys even being questioned  No ones been held accountable for trying to use guns as a way to show America and push for stricter gun control laws  Incredibly  as our own government goes to extremes to try and infringe on the right that shall not be infringed  the president is also at the same time this weekend advising American students to ignore anyone who warns against big  out of control governments VIDEO  President Obama  Unfortunately  youve grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity thats at the root of all our problems  Some of these same voices also do their best to gum up the works  Theyll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner  You should reject these voices This is amazing to me  This is truly amazing  He says youve grown up  This is very reminiscent of what Al Gore said where  you know  you just know things that your parents dont  youve grown up hearing voices  Will whos been telling them that  Whos been telling them  Certainly not in the classroomthey havent been told this in the classroom Nobody has taught Thomas Jefferson in quite some time  who said  The price of liberty is eternal vigilance  George Washington said  Government is not reason  It is not eloquence  it is force like fire  it is a dangerous servant and fearful master He had so little trust in government that he fretted over his job title  He wanted be called president  Everybody else wanted him to be called king He and the other framers were more concerned about building a government that wouldnt get out of control  Its what they feared the most  Fast forward now 236 years  and our president now scoffs at Washington and Jeffersons advice and instructs Americas youth to just trust the government  trust them  and reject anyone who is vigilant  basically saying the government cant go bad  There cant be a tyrannical government  a tyrant taking over  so let your guard down Let me tell you something  We have failed to teach our kids not only American history but world history  We have failed to such an extent that the students didnt even laugh  May I ask you a question  Imagine if the president gave this very same speech in Egypt or any of the former communist countries  Can you imagine Can you imagine if he went down to Foxconn  This is where your Apple iPad  oh Apple is such a great businesses  isnt it  Its fantastic  These people here are the ones who make your iPad for Apple  Imagine if he met in this cafeteria This is the building where you leave  Im sorry  you never leave  You live in this  and you never leave  because the business where theyre building your Apple product is underneath these housing tenants here  And they all go down to  like I think its the third floor and eat  And then they go down and work  and then they go up and sleep  Its beautiful existence  Thats why people are throwing themselves off this building  and theyre doing it because this is what the government tells them they have to do Now imagine if the president went down to the cafeteria in this building and said that  hey  dont listen to these people who say there might be a problem  there might be a tyrant  that somebody could control your life  Well  the fact is freedom is so rare  the experience that we have had living under freedomso rare  Ninety five percent of the time  mankind has lived under some form of oppression  Only 5  of all the people throughout human history have lived free  Its an exception  not the rule Washington and Jeffersons advice was wise  To advise otherwise is reckless  It flies in the absolute face of history  Government tyranny  thats what this office has always guarded against  government tyranny  I mean  Abe Lincoln  he freed the slaves  right  What was that all about  What was that about  What was the Civil War about  The slaves were liberated  and then later  they were severely discriminated against I did the speech this last Saturday  Please watch it  because I talked about the political party that was set up to stop slaves who had been freed from having any freedom  It was all about power  How about this  the wrong Native Americans  This is a government agent standing on the top  and those are buffalo heads  These government agents would go out  and they would kill all the buffalo  And then they would stack them up in a pile to say to the Indians  no food for you  Get out Was that individuals that did that  or was that the United States government  Mr  President  I cant believe that you tried to present yourself as a friend of the oppressed  Who was it that slaughtered tens of millions  Well  it was Mao  It was Stalin  It was Hitler  It was Pol Pot  It was Mugabe  Should I go on  Those are just the last 20th century One of the presidents advisers said power generally comes from the barrel of the gun  Well  whos he quoting  Mao  power comes from the barrel of the gun  He should know  He killed 80 million people  Mr  President  you have a guy who says thatwe generally agree with Mao Well maybe the president  maybe the president just meant America  that it never happens in America  You have to have this conversation with your friends about slavery  Forget about your friends  Have this conversation with your kids  because your kids are being taught the exact opposite junk You ask your kids and anybody who will listen to you thats more than just politics  that really cares about the country  ask them about this advice that the president gave to the students  and if they generally agree or disagree  If theyre like  well  Im not really  have a talk with them What about the enslaved African Americans  Who enslaved them  Was it the people or the government  The secret is it is the people  but the government is the enforcer  It has to come from the people  Thats why we have to be good  decent people  But its the government that is the enforcer We had indentured servitude here in America  but then in 1654  things changed  John Casor became the first legal slave in America  He was owned by an African American  Did your friends know that  Do your kids know that  Look it up  John Casor How did it happen  Well  John said  I just bought this guy  and I have him for life  And he said no  indentured servitude  No  for life  Well  he went to court  Who ran the court  the people or the government  It was the government of England at the time  It was a court decision that started slavery here in America So ask your friends after slaves were freed with the Emancipation Proclamation  was the government in the south not operating as tyrants  They had already lost  but then what happened  The government in the south rose up again for reconstruction How about the way they treated the Native Americans  This is a tragic story of how I mean they killed an entire tribe  On Saturday  I had the gun of Kicking Bear of this tribe  This was for gun control  this picture  gun control  What Im trying to understand here is how the president could make a statement like that in the face  not only of all of the facts  but also his own past I mean  what happened to the guy who listed all the horrible things about America  one right after another  In France  he said Americans were arrogant and dismissive and derisive  Does he mean the people  like the people we know next door  The American people are arrogant  dismissive  and derisive  Or did he mean the government was  Because I know a lot of people who are arrogant  but I dismiss them  It only matters if  you know  they have power In Turkey  he said the United States was still working through some of our darker periods in history  What does that mean  Maybe its this  when we rounded up the Japanese Americans  Is that what this is  I love this picture  This is in my office  Office of Free Press  but this is an internment camp for the Japanese Americans Or maybe it was the Native Americans or slavery  which darker period  Was there some darker period where hundreds of thousands ended up in total misery that was done by our neighbors and not the government  In Trinidad  he said the United States has been disengaged  and at times  we sought to dictate our terms  Who  Steve  or the United States government In Egypt  he said America acted out of fear and anger  after which 9 11 led us to act contrary to our traditions and our ideals  He condemned the U S  soldiers in the Quran burning  which they did nothing wrong  He scolded America over torture tactics  I know Bob down the streets not torturing anybody  The government is  Now we can add Mexico to that list Im sorry  Mr  President  I just dont know who youre talking about  Who do you mean  Do you mean the government  Because I dont agree with you  but if you mean the neighbor down the street  I agree with you  Dont worry  Theyre not going to really become a tyrant  unless youre down the street is 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue or anybody who works at the Capitol building See  he forgets his own speeches  I think  because I dont think he actually even reads them  He just says the words that are on the screen  I could be wrong  I dont know  But one of the things he warns about  still warns about  is how the government is in bed with Wall Street and big oil and big pharmaceutical  Well  isnt that tyranny He said the police acted stupidly  Isnt that tyranny  He went to a church for 20 years with a guy who said the United States government is so evil it created the HIV virus in order to kill African Americans  Dont believe me  Watch VIDEO  Rev  Jeremiah Wright  The government lied about inventing the HIV virus as a means of genocide against people of color  Governments lie  The government lied about a connection between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein and a connection between on 9 11 01 and Operation Iraqi Freedom  Governments lie Okay  the governments lie  I mean everybody that surrounds this guyVan Jones  a 9 11 truther who signed a petition that said the United States blew up the World Trade Center in order to further its militaristic agenda  He also  Van Jones says we stole the wealth from the American Indians VIDEO  Van Jones  They now own and control 80  of the renewable energy resources  No more broken treaties  No more broken treaties  Give them the wealth  Give them the wealth Okay so we stole the wealth  This is current  He is saying we stole the wealth  Okay  Currently  this president is acquaintances  neighbors with Bill Ayers  who didnt just say he hated the government  He literally tried to overthrow it by building bombs and bombing buildings In 2008  New York City judge recalled the Weather Undergrounds attempt to kill his family said  We didnt leave our burning house for fear of who might be waiting outside  The same night  bombs were thrown at a police car in Manhattan and two military recruiting stations in Brooklyn  Sunlight  the next morning  revealed three sentences of blood red graffiti on our sidewalk  Free the Panther 21  the Viet Cong have won  kill the pigs Does he mean real pigs  Mr  President  Does he mean the neighbor pigs  or does he mean the cops as your hippie friends used to say  Cops  you know  the kind that act stupidly and work for the government  Who was Bill Ayers trying to stop in Vietnam  my neighbor  Skippy  or the government This is all very reminiscent of when he told American students not to watch me but read instead the Huffington Post VIDEO  President Obama  If youre somebody who only reads the editorial page of the New York Times  try glancing at the page of the Wall Street Journal once in a while  If youre a fan of Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh  try reading a few columns on the Huffington Post website I do  Hillary Clinton said to watch Al Jazeera  America  its not really about who we listen to in the media  Its what we know to be true of who we really are  This is the place where we really come together as Americans  and if we cant  I mean  were just not going to make it  We have to unite on a few things Can we unite on at least those things that our country is up against  Can we unite on a few things just to move our country forward  I mean  I want maximum freedom and maximum responsibility  Those people who believe in government but know that governments go corruptI mean  we all knew it was corrupt under George W  Bush  Its worse now  but it was corrupt then  Cant we agree on that  Cant we unite on that one thing We have to reach out to our friends and neighbors and not in anger but in gentleness and peace  People are going to become more and more angry as the days go by  We need to unite and become one in mind  The lies  the deception  has to stop  Ive never asked you to take my word on anything  nor will I The pictures of the internment camps  you know  the buffalo piles  I want you to ask your kids if they know about it  Ask them to do a research paper on it  Do it with them  Do a paper on it  Have them find online the things our government has done that is bad  You know  thats something that the left would always say  Oh no conservative would tell you to do that I want you to look these things up  I want you to know them  It will  believe it or not  deepen your love and respect for the country when it goes right  It will help you keep the country going right  We did horrible things  Look up the Lakota Indians  horrible  horrible stuff  I talked about em at the NRA I said a lot of things at the NRA  and if you havent seen the speech  I urge you to watch it  Its available at TheBlaze com or I think at GlennBeck com  The transcript is up there now  but you should read it or watch it  Anybody that says trust me  trust me on this  dont even think about it  dismiss everybody  you shouldnt trust them Make a list of all the people that you truly trust right now  Have your kids do the same  Who do you trust with your money  Ask yourself as a parent or ask your neighbors  Your money  your Social Security  your sensitive information  your e mails  your childrens education  your welfare  your health  all of those thingscan you name the individuals that you would just blindly hand over  that you would put your kids into their trust for their welfare  their education  everything else  and not ask any questions I cant think of anybody  I mean  good friends  I wouldnt do that  I would certainly not hand my kids future and literally hand my kid over all day without asking any real questions  I certainly wouldnt do that to anybody who still works in Washington I dont have to believe that the government blew up the World Trade Center or created AIDS  but I know if I sat in a church where they taught that for 20 years  I dont think Id be the guy who came out and said  Hey  the government is good  What I would actually try to do  if I sat in that church for 20 years  and I had all of the friends that he has  what I would actually try to do is try to dismantle it  because this would be evil  All this would be evil to me  because if I heard that my whole life  I would despise this  My wife wouldnt be able to get out of here fast enough Jefferson  Washington  and all the presidents in our past  all of them have warned about getting too cozy with big business with our government  warned  Watch the government when they start getting into bed with special interest  It means the government will make laws that are good for those special interests  the banks or GE but not good for you  Well  isnt that tyranny  Someone from the left should understand this concept You see  theyve always maintained that our biggest danger to society was special interest groups  the banks  big money  big business  or big corporations  Well  thats whats happening now  Big business and big corporations and big military  theyre getting together  And I cant figure out how Im the one now saying that and warning the left  Your friends should be warned and just ask the question  Im puzzled The first president to warn about this  the one who gave the hippie left their whole language was a Republican  Dwight Eisenhower  I believe Dwight Eisenhower may be the last president who actually really spoke the truth on this issue very openly  Watch VIDEO  President Eisenhower  In the councils of government  we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence  whether sought or unsought  by the military industrial complex  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist  We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes Okay  so what hes saying is the military  the government  along with business  if you put them together  its disastrous  The potential for disastrous and misplaced power exists and will persist  Its arrogance or a lie that this president would believe that he has defeated this threat for all time  eternal vigilance  Eternal vigilance is no longer required Well  thats what hes telling the students  and why is he telling the students to put their guard down  Its eternal vigilance  and every president on both sides of the aisle have always said that  Is that why hes okay with taking guns away from law abiding citizens  because were safe  Does he recognize the opening that some future tyrant would have if we werent vigilant at all  Or is there something else The potential always exists  Thats why we have to teach our children the opposite of what everybody in school is teaching them today  The president is teaching our college graduates  Its not just other countries  Its not just China  Its not Cuba  which they have been taught isnt so bad  I dont want to live in Cuba  Do you Its not individual Americans  because individual Americans dont have the force of law behind them  If I dont have the force of law  I cant be a Fascist  I can have fascistic tendencies  but I cant be a Fascist  because I cant force you to do anything  If Hitlers living next door  but he doesnt have control of the government and the media and everything else  Hitlers just a crazy neighbor that I dont want to live next to Governments do things  Those governments have to be created  and then those governments have to be let go  and so the people allow that government that the people created to become bad  The people had to allow Andrew Jackson and that big government to follow manifest destiny that wiped Indians out We had to allow Woodrow Wilson to round up the dangerous foreigners and naturalized American citizens  you know  of German and Irish ancestry  The people had to allow slavery and segregation and Jim Crow laws  They had to allow FDR and the progressive icon to round up the Japanese through executive order and put them in an internment camp Weve heard forever the horrors of Jim Crow laws  but could we focus onjust a second  its the last word there in those three that give it power  Jim Crowe laws  written  and more importantly enforced  by a government  If were not vigilant  who will stop Jim Crow laws from happening again It would be a miracle if our young generation even noticed  because theyre being taught to exchange freedoms and responsibility for government freebies and promises of protection  Well feed you  Well keep you safe  Just trust us with more of your money and higher taxes  Give us your guns  Let us come into your house whenever were shutting a city down looking for somebody Were raising a generation that doesnt understand nor appreciate the value of freedom  We have to teach them  Please  do some homework with your kids tonight  I dont care how old they are  Do some homework with your kids  Last century was one of the deadliest in the world  In all of human history  last century was the worst  Why  because the neighbors down the street in Germany or because of those who had power of governments  Evil claimed the lives of millions  but goodness prevailed VIDEO  Glenn Beck  Because of people like Dietrich Bonhoeffer  later Martin Luther King and Lech Walesa  Mother Teresa  Henrietta Szold  they awoke the world  They gave their lives in the pursuit of human rights  They took the side of justice against injustice  They held aloft the torch of freedom to push back the darkness of hate But the cause now of human rights has been taken over by organizations who share little with those individuals who originally led those movements  Human rights  the cry  but I have a right  used to be a plea  All too often now it has become a threat These organizations now have become bullies and grotesque parodies of the principles they pretend to represent  They criticize free nations  They criticize the free nations  and they spare the unfree  They denounce nations like Israel and America who have high standards for freedom  and they leave alone the nations that have no freedom at all  They are nearly comical in their double standards  Whatever moral force they once have had is spent  and so today  we dismiss them Those words are almost two years old now  but they were alive again this weekend at the NRA speech  It was the tale of two weekends  those who realize that freedom is in trouble  the freedom of all mankind is at stake  and those who dont or dont care  The lines are being drawn  and it is time to choose sides  Its really pretty easy to choose  Im going to show you the signs of the near future  the sides of the near future  by showing you the sides and the signs  the echoes of the past  next ,0

The Senate successfully blocked  or failed to pass  depending on what side of the argument your on  new gun regulations yesterday  including expanded background checks 60 votes were needed to pass the Amendments proposed  all 9 failed to meet that mark  The major spotlight was on the Manchin Toomey background check amendment  which was defeated in a vote of 54  aye  to 46  nay  Democrat Senators Harry Reid  Baucus  Begich  Heitkamp  and Pryor voted no alongside 90  of GOP Senators  Republican Senators John McCain  Collins  Kirk and Toomey voted in favor of the legislation TheBlaze com breaks down all of yesterdays votes HERE After the votes took place a visibly angry President Obama took to the podium to lambast Congress  Or as Pat put it  he was pissed While somewell  most Americans might think three days after a terrorist attack is a time for the President to show resolve  an ability to agree to disagree is times of struggle  and  quite frankly  an attitude fitting of a man who cant get everything he wants  Barack Obama does not Surrounded by families of victims of the Newtown  CT massacre President Obama declared it a shameful day for Washington after 46 senators successfully blocked an amendment to expand background checks for gun buyers  vowing that it was just round one The allegedly bi partisan  common sense gun legislation failed to get votes from all 52 Democrat Senators  In fact  more Democrats voted against the common sense gun reform than vote FOR the Presidents very own budget See the Presidents full remarks below Assuming the President understands that even if this legislation had passed in the Senate  it would have been struck down by the GOP controlled House  his livid appearance during yesterdays speech seems much more tied to his inability to secure votes from his own party and his ego than to the actual legislation Glenn was literally speechless in his response to the Presidents attitude yesterday I dont even know what to say  he stated this morning  We are in such a dangerous situation right now  Our country is in a dangerous a precarious situation Regardless of where the Democrats  Republicans  the President  or even the average American stand on gun reform  the American people are in a situation where they need leadership  Three days ago  two bombs went off at the Boston Marathon  killing 3 and severely injuring over 170  Letters laced with ricin poison were sent to the President and members of Congress within the last 48 hours  And  after the Presidents speech  a massive explosion rocked West  Texas last night  killing multiple people  wounding hundreds  and nearly wiping the small town off the map  The terrorists from the Boston attack are yet to have been caught  and the details of the investigation are fuzzy Needless to say  Americans are on edge  distraught  and a little scared  That said  Americans are coming together to support each other and pull through the current challenges  Meanwhile  our president is yelling at Congress on a global stage After 9 11  Rudy Guiliano was asked about how he was able to keep his composure during such a frightening and uncertain situation  He explained The hallmark of the fully mature  fully functioning  self actualizing personality is the ability to be objective and unemotional when caught up in the inevitable storms of daily life  The superior person has the ability to continue talking to himself in a positive and optimistic way  keeping his mind calm  clear and completely under control  The mature personality is more relaxed and aware and capable of interpreting events more realistically and less emotionally than is the immature personality  As a result  the mature person exerts a far greater sense of control and influence over his environment  and is far less likely to be angry  upset  or distracted  My father used to say to me  Whenever you get into a jam  whenever you get into a crisis or an emergency      become the calmest person in the room and youll be able to figure your way out of it Thats the sign of leadership  If the president isnt going to act like a leader  maybe he should follow the example being set by the first responders and the American people who are resiliently finding a way to rise above the current struggles of this week ,0
A video of a 15 year old Maryland girl delivering a passionate defense of the Second Amendment during a hearing at the Maryland State Legislature last month has gone viral  While TheBlaze first covered the story last week  the story has gained traction elsewhere  Glenn discussed the testimony  which now his nearly 2 7 million views on You Tube  on radio this morning Let me go to the 15 year old girl in Maryland who had some testimony on gun control  Glenn said  She is a wee bit anti gun control The teenager has been identified as Sarah Merkle  a high school sophomore and member of the Maryland Rifle Club and Maryland State Rifle Team  During her testimony  Merkle explained that she has been shooting for almost eight years and because of this I have become eligible for various shooting scholarships around the country to a wide array of even the most prestigious colleges that have shooting teams It is her eloquent defense of gun rights  however  that has gotten the most attention MERKLE  Ever since I first learned how to shoot  the issue with gun violence around the nation became clear  Guns are not the problem  people are  Purging our society of violence and murder cannot be done through gun control legislation  By signing this legislation  you are not signing away gun violence  but instead liberating American citizens of our constitutional rights  You are not eliminating guns from society  but eliminating our ability to protect our lives  liberty  and pursuits of happiness  Chicago  Illinois has had some of the strictest gun laws in American enacted for the last few years  and it is currently more than twice as likely for you to be killed in Chicago as in the Afghani war  Is that really something we want to model our state laws after No  Glenn said matter of factly  And that is a fact  That is true  It is more dangerous to be in the streets of Chicago than it is to be in Afghanistan  That is phenomenal Despite their gun control laws  Pat added  despite the fact that you cant own a gun  virtually  in Chicago Chicago has proven time and time again that gun control laws are simply not the answer  but Glenn explained why the left doesnt see it that way  But see  heres the problem  You make this argument  Glenn said in response to Pat  The problem is theyre going to say  Well the only reason thats happening is because people can get guns from someplace else in the United States  They can bring them in from another state  They can just bring them in  Thats why Well  youre going to eliminate and meltdown every gun in the world  Glenn asked  I mean  really  Do these progressives not learn from things like prohibition When you look at the black market that emerged during the prohibition era in the United States or the fact that people are able to obtain drugs like heroin  cocaine  marijuana  etc  fairly easily despite their illegal status  it becomes clear that the act of banning or criminalizing does not ensure the problem disappears Furthermore  when you look at murder and crime rates in relation to gun laws in other major U S  cities  the situation in Chicago becomes even more startling  How does that argument work when in places like Houston and Dallas  where we go by the Second Amendment  we dont have the problem that they do in Chicago  Pat asked  People can get them here  locally  and we dont have that problem  So that doesnt make any sense either Its the Detroit story  Glenn concluded  Wherever progressives have ruled for a very long time and broken the family in half  and made everyone reliant on the government  and regulated their lives  and taught their children all this garbage Watch Merkles entire testimony below   ,0
by Spencer Coursen  Coursen Security Group When designing any emergency response plan  it is important to first identify the most realistic threat you are likely to face  Imaginations will always exceed budgets  so identifying and mounting a defense against the threat you are most likely to face will help manage your fear and your finances in equal measure Im a fan of The Walking Dead as much as anyone  but the thought of zombie coming in through my windows on a some random Tuesday afternoon hell bent on eating me alive  brings me about as much anxiety as the thought of a grizzly bear scaling a downtown apartment building intent on doing the same  Its just not going to happen The Realistic Scenario Why are we talking about Bunkers in the first place Anyone whos walked through an airport in the last ten years  has heard  Threat Level  Orange which is a non invasive way for Homeland Security to say  Yes  there is a reasonable expectation for a violent terrorist threat to breach our borders However  this next attack will very likely be a 9 11 style attack  Which is to say  a singular or coordinated attack all happening at once  not unlike the hours between 8am and 11am on September 11th  The intent of a terrorist threat is meant promote fear and panic rather than to engage in a continuous and prolonged campaign of direct action We as a nation  are also under continuous attack by the  Chinese  shadow warfare cyber tactics probing and potentially infecting our financial institutions  our water supply  and our transportation systems  in what Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has warned as a Cyber Pearl Harbor Natural disasters also seem more frequent  Hurricane Katrina and Super Storm Sandy brought to the forefront of national attention just how devastating and time consuming these atrocities can be to endure Regardless of the crisis you may face  what all of these scenarios have in common is the challenge to your safety and security after the event has occurred  When the dust has settled  the winds have died  and the waters calmed  you must survive until the return to normal  and my hope is this helps you find the best way to do so For agreement in discussion  I am employing the term bunker in the same fashion I would employ safe haven  a defendable place where you and your family can spend evenings in conditional safety and reasonable comfort Preparedness is Paramount Preparing for what comes next  will prepare you for what comes before  Your mind and your body are finely tuned with each other  and stressors on the mind will have physiological affects  much as stressors on the body have psychological affects I was in a car accident recently  t boned while driving down Venice Blvd in Los Angeles  The entire drivers side door caved in  It was a bad accident  and Im lucky to have walked away unscathed from the wreck  I tell you this  because no sooner had their speeding car slammed into mine  when two things went simultaneously went through my mind  The first was a once learned and Army instilled self assessment of my physical condition telling me I was not hurt and to get moving  and the second was a mental re assurance my car insurance was paid and up to date There was nothing I could have done to prevent the accident  There was no warning  and I had no opportunity to avoid  evade or escape the collision  Yet  I was in complete control over what came next  because I knew I had done everything up to that moment to prepare for this one My seatbelt was on having safeguarded my life  and my insurance was paid having safe guarded my livelihood  Had either of those two preparations not been previously handled  I would most definitely not have been in a physical or psychological condition to deal with the aftermath with rational logic and effectiveness  Additional stressors were not a factor  because I had taken the necessary measures to prepare for this very likely and realistic scenario What should I do first You are right hereright now  Stop reading this article for a second and look around  One second from now  your world and your life will change forever  Are you ready Safety First  Protect yourself and get to a safe and sustainable location  You will know your home and your neighborhood the best  so get there as quickly and as safely as you can Contact anyone and everyone while if you still can  Let trusted people  friends and family  know where you are  where you are going  youre physical condition as well as anything you may need  If you havent already done so  initiate your family emergency plan so that everyone knows where to go and what to do Take inventory  Who is with you and what you have on hand  If you dont have what you need  decide immediately how important it is to have vs  the risk of retrieval  This will obviously be a situational dependent statement  but as a rule  anything less than the life of a loved one  and you should prepare yourself to be without Triage  Is anyone hurt or injured  Require immediate medical attention  What do you need to do to ensure the health  welfare and safety of those in your charge tonight  Are you safe where you are  Can you safely move to a better location  You will need to determine the most important tasks often as priorities may shift at any given moment   Always be thinking  Safety  Food    Shelter Delegate  If you are of good enough fortune to be with others  utilize them to their full advantage  There is strength in numbers  Do Not try to do everything yourself If anything can be done 70  as well as you  delegate that tasking to another  Theyll learn as they go  and getting something done is better than getting nothing done Where you live will determine what you need Most of us surviving a crisis situation will be restricted to the  immediatevicinity of our homes with little to no power or communication Where you live will determine the necessity of what is needed for your specific situation If you live in an urban environment  where daily deliveries to markets and groceries are required  then your focus should be on food storage more so than if you live in a more rural environment where you could feasibly live off the land in a hunter gather capacity Dependence on machine generated climate control is another factor to consider  Understanding the susceptible changes to the natural climate of your location should be factored when deciding where to bunker down What is a reasonable expectation of duration 4 nights   5 days of on hand rations is a good rule of thumb  Emergency services are generally able to provide basic assistance within three days  However  having value added goods on hand  Cigarettes and Alcohol  will afford you the ability to barter and exchange for necessities later on should the crisis continue indefinitely Who can I trust You already know the answer to this  If youre thinking  I think so  then the answer is no  If you can unequivocally say  Yes  than the answer is yes  One may never know where loyalty is born  but the beginning of a crisis isnt when you want to find out  Alliances start now  Community counts  Find like minded friends and neighbors who live in close proximity and start discussing the roles and functions of those who can provide varying and essential skills and services For example  if your neighbor has a generator  and you have a giant freezer full of food in your garage  talk to each other now and work out a system to combine resources should the time come  If any of your neighbors are Doctors  RNs or Police  invite them over for dinner What should I have on hand As I stated before  your own needs will be conditional upon your situation  Whats listed here is by no means the must haves  but rather the should haves for basic home defense and survival  I have listed them here in order of priority according to my own personal experience and practice 1  Enough food  water and prescription medication to last you five days  Assume your water wont be running or will be deemed unsafe  Buy one case of water for everyone in your family and stash it under the bed  in the basement or in the closet   Somewhere out of sight and out of mind so you wont use this cache as your go to supply for car trips Water is the one thing youll always wish you had in abundance  Some of it youll drink  some of it youll need to boil  some of it youll use to bath  You really cant have enough Your food on hand should be shelf stable and require no addition preparation  Its likely the power will be out and if youre living in an apartment or similar enclosed location  building a fire wont always be possible  High calorie  high protein and complex carb meals will be the best  Watch some old school cowboy movies for inspiration  Stock up on some cans of beans and beef stew  Beef Jerky and Trail Mix  Look into Paleo Kits too  Extreme athletes and Cross Fit enthusiast swear by them  I recommend you purchase at least one to see if you like them  On a budget  its much cheaper to modify and make your own  Local purchase the ingredients you like and vacuum seal individual single servings  PaleoKit as shown  Cost  7 2  Have some extra bags of ice in the freezer  king cubes will last you longer than the icemaker variety  Ice will help keep your refrigerator and freezer functional for a day or two after the power goes out  Fill up a few tuba ware containers filled with water and freeze overnight  Keep as many frozen bricks in your freezer as you can  Ice does more than chill your drinks  there are medical uses  Blister Burn  splinter removal  oral numbness to treat tooth pain  and soft tissue injury to name a few  so having some on hand will prove beneficial to your cause 3  A go bag is  in layman terms the bag you grab when its time to Go  as in right now  when the time required to plan  prep and pack will mitigate your chance of survival  The premise is such that your go bag is always packed  ready and waiting with the essentials you will need to survive for two nights and three days in the outdoor terrain of your approximate location and in current local climate  No creature comforts  just the necessities to survive  contained in a packaged weight  affording you the ability to remain mobile  Keep in mind  your packing list may change throughout the year dependent upon the time of year  the season  your location  your medical requirements and your physical ability  You should be well versed in terms of your bags content  knowledgeable of item location  and organized for ease of use Everyone who is physically able to carry a pack should have one  Your own individual packing list may vary based on personal preference and necessity  but the contents of the one below serves as an excellent tutorial on what constitutes essentials  If you only do one thing to prepare beyond your in home food and water storage  this is it  This is what you need  Everyone should have one  Build or buy one today  Many pre customized options are available on line  As shown on Amazon com Cost   310 4  A fully stocked First Aid kit is a priority requirement for any emergency action plan  One should always strive to have as much medical and trauma training  resources and equipment on hand as possible  Medical equipment can be cost prohibitive  but medical knowledge can be as cheap as a YouTube search  Being First Aid and CPR certified  or at least capable  could literally save a life one day  and could increase your own survival rate exponentially Staff infection is both silent and deadly  and if you find yourself unable to acquire professional medical attention or prescription medication  it is critical you possess  at the very least  the medical know how and resources to clean  disinfect and treat a cut  scrape  or sprain This standard First Aid kit is commonly found in commercial venues  but doublesequally well in the home  Cost   25 5  Despite all of the technological advances of the past century  the best home defense option available to you is still a mid to full sized dog  especially one with specific  Sentry  training tailored to your needs  In addition to being naturally defensive of their owner  and territorial of their property  a dog can offer a companionship in an otherwise lonesome scenario   Think  I am Legend vs Castaway  If you already have a dog  even an untrained small dog  youre already ahead of the game  The yelp of a small pup directed toward an unwelcome visitor may be all thats required to bring undo attention to clandestine activities and thwart their evil intentions 6  In every home there should be an identified Safe Room  a last line of defense where you and your loved ones can safely barricade yourselves until help can arrive  There is literally no limit to the amount of money one can spend on the construction such a sanctuary For the rest of us  we have door wedges  These specific door wedges were designed by EMS units to keep the heavy industrial doors propped open during their rescue operations  As good as they are at propping doors open  they are even better at wedging doors closed  Jam one of these under a closed door and there is no way an intruder is pushing the door open  Added security if you wedge one between the door and the frame too   Just make sure youre on the side of the door that can see the hinges For a few dollars more  some door wedges also come with an alarm feature  but if you can sleep through an intruder trying to kick down the door  Im not sure the alarm of a AA Battery will stir you from your slumber  Cost   8 00 7  Today  all of our communication devices require a charge  Assuming an EMP was not the cause of the crisis youre currently facing  your mobile devices will be critical to helping you negotiate your way to a better day   Read  One Second After by William Fortschen  While a few commercial venues with back up generators may be able to facilitate the needs of the few  they most certainly will not be able to cater to the needs of the many  So skip the Starbucks iPhone charging line and invest in this universal solar charging unit  Yes  there are cheaper versions available on the market place  but this one has been in my go bag for the last two years and has never once let me down  Cost   120 8  Take the time to go through all of the contents your go bag has available  and identify anything inside you think you may need to use in your home  Purchase in duplicate to whats in the bag  but do your best to NOT use whats already provided  If you dont already have the basics of a lights out scenario in your home  then you should most certainly acquire the necessary provisions of matches  candles  flashlights  and batteries  Other items of mention may also include a multi tool  a home improvement tool kit  survival literature  pocket knives  pre packaged meals such as MREs  or water purification tablets 9  Employ aspects of deterrence works  in hopes of promoting transference  The pros of a home security system far outweigh any cons  The innovation available on todays modern marketplace can match almost any imagination  and yet there are endless options available to work within the confines of even the tightest budget A good security system will alert  notify  and confirm the something someone out of the ordinary with enough lead time for you to respond accordingly  More importantly  a positive security posture promotes one very important fact to the causal observer  You take your security seriously  At any given time  our friends  neighbors  and general passers by are evaluating our actions  behaviors  and even our daily routines And we do this to others  We know which stores are safer than others  which stores we visit take their security more seriously than others  which office buildings are safer  which parking garages are more closely monitored  We even intrinsically know which streets are safe at night  and which streets we go out of our way to avoid  All of this observational knowledge is subconsciously remembered and categorized  and plays and important aspect in split second decision making scenarios regarding our own safety and security In times of crisis  necessity sometimes lends itself to immoral action  Social predators  looters  and criminals of opportunity will always reveal themselves when social order is in chaos  Like lions stalking a herd of gazelle  they will evaluate the masses to identify the easy prey vs  those whom pose a challenge  a target drawn on the weakest and most vulnerable first However  criminals often act with childhood methodology in that hard work isnt warranted unless theres a guaranteed reward for their effort  otherwise only the least bit of effort shall be asserted  So  forget for a moment  that in this crisis scenario you face  there is no power and your system doesnt work  The camera dome above your door or next and next to your window  says something succinct about your home  Another target will be easier 10  Despite the fact that movies and television will have you convinced otherwise  a weapon will not be required or necessary for your survival in nearly every conceivable crisis you will realistically face  However  as a former soldier I would be lying to you if I told you I didnt have a weapon as part of my own emergency action plan  If you decide to include a weapon in your inventory  please familiarize  and train yourself to the fullest extent possible  and employ safety  rational thought and sound moral guidance in all aspects of its use With all aspects considered  my final recommendation is the Mossberg 500 JIC  Mossberg revealed their understanding of emergency preparedness to heart when naming their Model 500 JIC  which stands for Just In Case  A shotgun such as this serves many masters  It not only acts as a psychological deterrent to the Social Predator when they hear the unmistakable chuh chik of the slide chambering a round  and being honest  you dont exactly have to be surgical when firing it either This weapon is equally effective at dropping the bad guy  or the flock of ducks flying overhead for dinner  This weapon is lightweight  easy to use  and gets the job done  Just in case you really find yourself in need  or want  of a versatile and dependable weapon  having this on hand will serve you well  Cost   479 Everyday a school day Your individual list of needs  wants and desires may be completely different than mine  but whats most important is that youre forward thinking to a scenario you can help frame and manage before you find yourself whiplashed by the harsh reality of whatever unfortunate predicament life prescribes One advantage of advance preparation is that you afford yourself the extra time needed to get yourself ready both mentally and physically for whatever tomorrow may bring  Preparation requires forethought and action  and if youve read this far  you have already improved your odds for a successful outcome  Real life is different from little league tee ball  No participation trophies here  Big Boy rules are in effect  Expect the worst  and hope for the best  Know that problems will arise  and when life breaks bad it often finds you when you are least expecting  and most ill prepared Remember that survivors and winners have something in common  they both visualize victory  even when hope seems forsaken  and the odds are stacked against you  Champion Poker Player  Jack Strauss embodies this philosophy with one of his key quotes after winning the World Series of Poker  I had a chip  and a chair  so I knew I had a chance Hard work and sacrifice must be accepted as your reality  In the end  your commendation for action will not come in the form of applause or congratulations  and certainly not a trophy  but rather in knowing that you and your loved ones will sleep in peace some future night because of your preparation today As Im signing off  an email alert pops up with the subject line  Zombie Kit  I smile a little  and then stop  Like the Mossberg  maybe I should include this too  You know  Just in Case  Cost   349   ,0

Updated 3 20 Hello  America  and welcome to The Glenn Beck Program and to TheBlaze  This is the network that you are building  and dare I say the only network surprisingly bold enough to bring you the stories that are important  so important that the mainstream media has missed or I believe chosen to ignore  and they mean something to you  In the next 30 minutes  youre going to learn things about the U N  and their new arms treaty that youre not going to hear anyplace else on television First  let me give you a quick update  the president is on the ground now in Israel  No word if he has found any really expensive golf courses yet  but well keep you up to speed on that  Let me also give you the latest on the global economic meltdown  at least the one that is coming  Maybe this is the beginning of it  Lets go Cyprus where we were yesterday  They have rejected the Euro Zones bailout offer This bailout came with a condition  The people of Cyprus were going to lose part of their savings accounts  Anything that you had in the bank  you were going to be taxed anywhere from 6  to 10  I love that  Hey  everybody  were not going to tell you about it  Were just going to take money from your account  Were not stealing  Well  I mean  were not stealing as much from you as we are the rich guy  Cool  right The banks are remaining closed until Thursday over fears that there might be a run on the bank  Gee  you think there might be a run on the bank  No  What will likely happen is that the largest banks will now fail  and the country will go bankrupt  Uh oh  that sounds like an emergency  a crisis  And the people of Cyprus will now be left looking for a strongman  somebody that can fix this problem because there will be no other way out  Yet  there is a solution  and Ill tell you about in the minute  And I bet you they dont take it Heres whats really happening  the politicians in Europe are farther ahead in the decay scale than we are here  We dont trust our politicians at all  however  were not at the point the rest of Europe is at yet  The politicians have so discredited themselves here  but over in Europe  its happened for so long that the newly elected President of Cyprus can actually promise one thing and then three weeks later do exactly the opposite when it comes to your bank account and think he can get away with it  Hmm  I dont think so See  this is what this really means  the politicians know they no longer have any clout  They no longer have any possibility that they can change peoples minds  They know that they cant stand up in front of people and say  Hey weve got a do this  They have no chance of turning the tide of public opinion because there is zero credibility left in the tank for the politicians and the banks and everybody else This is the beginning of two things  two things globally  One  Totalitarianism  Totalitarianism  when the people are so far away from the politicians or the politicians are so far away from the people  and there is an emergency  and theres nobody with an answer  it will be handled by a strongman and in that part of the world probably the Nazis  I cant believe that we were mocked so much for talking about how the Nazis were going to come back and be a part of our lives again  and here they are  Theyre going to need a strongman  and it will happen The other thing that is happening here is this is a shark bump  Its a global shark bump  Cyprus is just kind of like the little Petri dish  Its the first to get it  Weve talked about shark bumps before on this program  Sometimes sharks will bump a potential meal before attacking  they just kind of rub into it to see if its going to fight back  I believe thats exactly what is happening with the EU  Will the people rise up and fight back  How do we handle this Cass Sunstein wrote a book called Nudge  The premise is that individuals are incapable of making any kind of correct choices so they need to be nudged into the right choice  Well  as it turns out  its weird  people dont like to be nudged  so they resist  and eventually a nudge has to turn into a shove  Weve talked about this many times in the past  Europeans have been nudged enough  and now theyre about to be shoved in a big way So why does this matter to you  Who cares if a few skinny jeans wearing  you know  Europeans get tossed around by big government  right  Because this is a global shark bump because we are all in this one together  Were just the last in the boat  but we are the biggest fish that will come into the boat Let me start here  The radicals in our own government are very interested observers  watching very closely how the people of Europe respond to this Cyprus offer  What are they going to do  What can the politicians do better next time  Cyprus is a teachable moment for all of the people that want to grab control of power  but it is also a teachable moment for us if we will just see it that way  It will explain a ton I think I asked you yesterday about guns  Has anybody asked why theyre limiting guns  Has anybody thought of that  Why are we limiting guns  And I told you last night it was Cyprus  but there is another thing  At the same time theyre limiting guns  theyve got soda  too  that theyre limiting  and those things make sense  right  Theyre limiting cigarettes  soda  trans fats  SUVs  That makes sense  These two make sense together  but then this one doesnt At the same time  they want you to be able to smoke pot  all the pot you want  apparently  We showed you Mike Bloomberg yesterday  and he is going after everything except  watch this video  except for pot VIDEO  Mayor Bloomberg  Commissioner Kelly and I support Governor Cuomos proposal to make possession of small amounts of marijuana a violation rather than a misdemeanor and will work to help him pass it this year  But Ill tell you  we arent going to wait for that to happen  Right now  those arrested for possessing small amounts of marijuana are often held in custody overnight  Were changing that  Effective next month  anyone presenting an I D  and clearing a warrant check Okay  stop  Do you have this  Hes got to go  today hes going after cigarettes  Hes got to go in after soda  Hes got to do these things  but he thinks its a waste of time to go after pot  Isnt that a health risk  If you believe that soda is a health risk  how is smoking pot  I dont care about  lets say the intoxication  the lungs  what its doing  He has to move cigarettes out of the way  but pot isnt a problem  Well maybe its because we couldnt afford it  because thats kind of what the president said yesterday  The president has said we have bigger fish to fry than going after pot smokers  Watch VIDEO  President Obama  As it is  you know  the federal government has a lot to do when it comes to criminal prosecutions  It does not make sense from a prioritization point of view for us to focus on recreational drug users in a state that has already said that under state law thats legal This puts us into a constitutional crisis  and you would think a man who is a constitutional professor would know that  Now think of this  we have  lets take him at his word  we have to prioritize things  So the man who made a big deal over free condoms at colleges  a man who spent his time lobbying to change the college football playoff system  doesnt have the time to keep us out of a constitutional crisis  But dont get lost there These two  these three  these two match  these three do not  Why is it these champions of manufacturing only healthy choices are not willing  theyre in favor of legalizing pot  Let me get back to this here in a second  and let me go over here  Why are Progressives trying so hard  Im sorry  over here  trying to take away your guns  here and internationally  See  this is not about Sandy Hook  because in international terms  Sandy Hook was no big deal We know why were supposedly going through it is because of the shooter in Sandy Hook  but why is the U N  arms treaty being pushed right now and going through  Theyre working on it right now And then  why is the administration pushing so hard behind the scenes to absolutely  totally control your childs education  the curriculum and every piece of access you as a parent have via Common Core  And in that educational system  they are teaching you about this  through here  theyre teaching you irrational fear of guns  a disdain for the Western way of life  how bad this is  but that one is popular still Why is Michael Bloomberg  the Mayor of New York City  injecting himself into a school board issue  as we told you last night  in New Orleans  This man is worried about who is elected to the Board of Education in New Orleans  He spent money on that race  when today we find out that 80  of those who graduate from high school in New York City are incapable of reading or writing or doing enough arithmetic to gain entrance to any level college  80  You would think if they dont have time to bust the drug users  they wouldnt have time to worry about cigarettes under the counter or education in another state The answer again  found in Cyprus  You see  before a strong arm  a strongman  or totalitarian government can grab power  they have to try to make people really  really want it  You have to train the citizens to think that their best friend is government  To cement that idea in place for all time  you have to teach kids to distrust their parents and instead make government their mom and dad  Remember this VIDEO  Al Gore  There are some things about our world that you know that older people dont know Got it  Strip away the authority of mom and dad  and this has been done for years  Give kids the green light to whatever they want  I mean  you cant have a soda  You cant have chips  You cant talk about God  but there are condoms and abortion pills in the vending machine in the hallway  and the health teacher is demonstrating the healthy ways for teenagers to engage in sexual promiscuity  This isnt making sense  is it We also have to cut mom and dad off from viewing the curriculum at all  and then were going to call it Common Core  meaning the core of who we are that is common  The common core of their world view comes now from school and radicals  not those old people like mom and dad who  I mean  you just know better than they do  And then they have a curriculum that teaches how bad the Western way of life is and the free market is  especially if youre just a greedy capitalist like Michael Bloomberg or George Soros  This is  if you were just a greedy capitalist  thats bad in the curriculum  but there is a better way  working for everybody in a communist utopia  and thats darn near exact from the textbook And then at the same time  you have to teach an irrational fear of guns  not a fear of guns  but an irrational fear of guns  You make kids afraid of assault Pop Tarts and pieces of scrap paper shaped like an L  and you call the police on that  Now  heres the latest example  I want to show you a picture  This was posted  I saw this picture  and New Yorkers would say  Oh  hes in camouflage with a gun  I saw that picture and I said  Look at the way hes holding the gun  This kids been well trained  It is unnatural for a kid to grab onto a gun  for anybody to grab onto a gun without putting their finger in with the trigger  You have to be trained to hold a gun like that  This kid has been well schooled  most likely from his parents Well  according to his dad  merely posting this picture prompted an unannounced visit from the New Jersey Department of Youth  who were accompanied by police officers  The police officers did not have a warrant  They demanded entry into this home and access to the firearms  Dad said  You dont have a warrant  beat it  I personally dont think this is the end of this story  I instructed TheBlaze today to make sure theyre on top of it and inform the family that if anything happens in the future to know that they have a friend in TheBlaze  We will bring you up to speed  We will be a watchdog But you have to understand  you are no longer mom and dad  The government is now the new mom and dad  but your new mom and dad is dangerous  How  Let me take you back to Cyprus because remember  theyre ahead on this timeline  Since the bailout offer has now been rejected  okay the idea was  Hey  were going to prop up the banks that have been screwing all of us  Were going to prop up the banks by taking 6 to 10  of everybodys savings  or were all going to die  Oh  wow  So they said  No  were not going to do that Now  there is another offer on the table  Russia has an offer on the table  and they said  Hey look  Cyprus  well pay for your bailout  You just let us explore in your water for oil or gas  But my guess is the dysfunctional mom and dad will not want a capitalist way out of this  They will not want to solve this problem  They need this problem  In fact  theyve just made it worse  Thats great  You lost 10  but now your banks are going to fail  so youre going to feel the immediate pain  and the message of control is more important than a solution to the problem  With this vote  their banks will fail  and the country will be in chaos  but mom and dad will be happy behind closed doors  because mom and dad will tell you  We told you so And the chaos will cause the children to  look  mom  dad  come help  Its whats happening right now in a small way with our Easter egg hunts and our White House tours  Why do you think hes cutting the Easter  they had a St  Pattys day party  but theyre cutting the Easter egg hunt  Why  To irritate you  I mean  if they think that were going to rise up over an Easter egg hunt and say  enough  enough  But thats whats happening  The Easter egg hunt and the White House tours  thats this Cyprus scenario  but Cyprus is at DEFCON 1 Thats why you must educate yourself  and it is why they are not educating but indoctrinating  You have to indoctrinate to be able to control  but then you have to disarm  You have to disarm the adults  because when you come after their life savings  their blood  sweat  and tears  their entire life  you better reduce the odds for a successful civilian uprising  You have to train em  You have to train em  and you have to take their guns away  limit the guns  I mean  you cant have a bunch of guns  right You limit the success of an uprising  limit it  but you need the uprising because you have the uprising allows a strongman to gain control  Look to Egypt for the prime example of this  By the way  in Cyprus  private citizens  we just looked this up about an hour ago  completely forbidden from owning handguns and rifles in any category  any caliber  They only are allowed to have shotguns  and those require a license  And theyre limited the two rounds  Joe Biden would fit right in So lets go back to drugs  because drugs and soda and guns doesnt make sense  unless you know history  the Weimar Republic  notorious for having extremely lenient drug laws  They infiltrated  discredited religion  and then they promoted reckless partying and promiscuity and drug use  People would get sauced up  Theyd forget their problems in sex  booze  or bong  See  this is what stuck out to me  Its interesting Progressives will go after a 16 ounce soda but not pot I mean  I understand if youre a Libertarian  you might be for legalizing drugs because you think the drug war doesnt work  and you think that  you know  theres no necessarily inherent value in you taking the drug  but you believe you should have the right because theyre not your parent  you are  You control  maximum freedom  maximum liberty  I get that  but Progressives typically dont believe that  or youd be allowed to have Ho Hos and a soda Why would Soros favor lenient drug laws  Cyprus is the answer  Before government can come for your life savings  youve got to limit the guns  but if theyre going to take everything that youve worked for in your entire life  I mean  youve got to have a getaway car  you know  You have to have an escape car for the Progressives  for the Totalitarians  You have to be able to control the citizens  and you need to have them just a little blurry eyed so you can get away fast  Its Oceans 11 times 16 trillion Heres what makes  I think  TheBlaze unique  Have you seen anybody put these facts together like this at all on the air  at all  Are you hearing anybody talking about why guns and soda and drugs and education  and what does Cyprus really mean The most important move on guns in the history of the world  a move that would guarantee the world would fall into the hands of thieves  technocrats and dictators is afoot right now  and our government knows it  and our press knows it  and its happening in New York City right now  And I believe were the only network talking about it  and Ill show it to you and finish this picture when we come back ,0
Tonight on the Glenn Beck Program  Glenn welcomed three guests who were armed with the facts about gun rights and the history of the Second Amendment  Star Parker  founder of the Coalition on Urban Renewal and Education  actor Joseph Phillips  and writer and activist Kira Ayn Davis all discussed the impact of gun control legislation on the African American community From the very beginning  the three panelists all focused on how gun control has been used as a tool to keep the African American community out of power The Democrats have never changed their strategy  They want people unarmed  uneducated and dependent on whoever that master is  Whether its the master that time in slavery or the master that keeps them enslaved to the welfare state  Star Parker told Glenn Parker explained that gun legislation was a way to keep free slaves from gaining any kind of power  She said that African Americans are being told to continually vote for politicians that want to keep them unarmed  uneducated  and dependent on the government Parker also took issue with background checks  noting that Adam Lanzas mother had her guns stolen from her  She did not think that a background check would have prevented that tragedy and that gun legislation is going to only take away the rights of law abiding citizens Joseph Phillips also delved into the history of African Americans  taking issue with Hollywood for portraying African Americans as cowards when faced with racist groups like the Ku Klux Klan in films Black people often fought back and fought back with guns  Phillips said Davis explained that when the KKK started  they would have local sheriffs go into black homes and confiscate their weapons and say they were taking them for safety reasons  Not long after  the KKK would come through and burn down the homes and murder the families once the guns were all gone Its an issue of our freedom  It should not be partisan  she said So what are the solutions Kira Ayn Davis encouraged African American conservatives to be good storytellers and make the case against increased government in personal lives We are fighting a social agenda that crosses color lines  Phillips said  Its standing up and saying Enough is enough and its loud action Parker said African Americans need to understand the truth behind the history of the parties and how Democrats have tried to keep the black community out of power  She also said they needed to recognize that th Second Amendment is a right and they should be active participants in it All three said the internet provides another avenue for conservative voices to cut through the traditional communication outlets that have dominated black communities for years Part 2 Part 3 ,0

Under the Castle Doctrine  a TX homeowner legally shot   killed a home invader  Despite his 18 page wrap sheet  the criminals family thinks he should have been warned He could have gave him a warning  One family member told reporters on the scene He could have let him know that he did have a gun on his property and that he was willing to use it in self defense  Dallas News   myFOXdfw com What was he supposed to say  Id appreciate it if you would not break into my home  Some harm may come to one or both of us if you continue this practice  Pat joked Glenn pointed out that the entire controversy around the Castle Doctrine goes against Natural Law  He explained that if someone wandered into a bears den and was killed  no one is going to be outraged at the bear   You walk into a cave of bears  the bear is going to kill you Its your fault  Glenn said He added that no one is going to put the bear up for trial  question if it wasnt loved enough as a child  or why it hates people so much   You walked into his den  You were stupid Why does the same common sense not apply to someones home   You shouldnt have been there  You have no right to be there I have a right to shoot you  Glenn said Thats what the Castle Doctrine is  a law that protects your natural rights of self defense   Does everyone deserve second chances like those being called for in this news report  Maybe  but Glenn points out  this guy had an 18 page rap sheet Thats 18 pages of chances Its insanity  Stu added This is what happened when you lose respect for the law This is why we talk about the border and things like this  If you want people to come across the border  you want more open borders  change the law to reflect that  Dont just ignore the law  because when you lose the rule of law you get attitudes like this Attitudes of I cant believe this person was shot as they were breaking into someones house Glenn went on to explain why its import to remember that the Constitution was based on Natures Law and Natures God  Its important to keep the foundation this debate on our Natural Rights Do you have a right to protect your own cave  Nature says  yes  Lets not go against nature  because that means youre born with that right  Theres no bear government giving the bear a right to protect its cave  Theres not a single law on the books  And only the stupid animals stumble into the bear cave  and those animals are eaten  And if there is a group of animals that are like you know what  I think we can take the bears one at a time  You take this cave you take that cave at 3 00 in the morning  And well take their honey  That species is wiped out because theyre eaten by the bear ,0
While CNN tries to decide whether or not winter storm Nemo was a result of man made global warming or not  there are two major stories that should be the priority for every news network   The first involves a 28 year old man from San Jose who thought he was working with the Taliban and tried to set of a car bomb in California  Luckily  he was working with the FBI  and was arrested  What was the 28 year olds goal with the thwarted violent attack  To frame the Tea Party  initiate a government crackdown on guns  thus sparking a civil war across the country The second story is one youre most likely already aware of  Chris Dorner  Dorner is the man who went missing in Los Angeles after killing three police officers Nobody can find him  which is almost inconceivable in this day and age but apparently hes been planning this for a really long time  Pat explained Pat went on to explain that the cop killer was formerly in the military and a policer officer himself  so he knows what hes doing  hes been trained by the people who are now looking for him  The thing that makes this story so outrageous is that there is growing support for Chris Dorner on the internet   Dorner  whose targets include the leaders of the NRA  wrote a long  murderous manifesto about how he hates the NRA  hates guns  yet used them to kill three people  and holds up people like MSNBCs Joe Scarborough and CNNs Piers Morgan as heroes   He said these guys get it  So what hes doing now is hes trying to further gun control as well  Glenn explained By killing people  Pat added Yet  he has supporters  a growing number of them  In fact  theyve created a Facebook page called Dorner for president that states  We propose electing a man who can no longer sit idly by and watch as malicious tyrants abuse the innocent Nearly 3 000 people now like the page I support Chris Dorner  and on another page We are all Chris Dorner  the description chillingly reads  Yes  this is war CBS 13 posted a simple question on one of the growing Facebook pages  Why Astonishingly enough  there were responses   Because something needs to be done about the long known corruption of not only the LAPD but several other agencies  one comment read Another stated  Hes God for now  and I support him and this page Glenn explained that these stories are related  not just because they both violence from the far left  but because of the reaction they are receiving  Had either of these involved people on the far right  or the car bomb in California had succeeded in framing the Tea Party  the coverage would be incredibly different  But because they arent  they arent receiving the appropriate amount of attention   Thats what were getting from the left  Pat said Thats the loving  tolerant  peaceful left in this country Glenn reminded Pat that  while yes  the media is missing the point on these stories  these could come from the far right anarchists screaming for revolution like we saw a few weeks ago with Alex Jones  Its not just the people on the left we have to worry about now Those people who are crying for revolution and Civil War on the extreme right  anarchy  or the anarchists and the communists on the extreme left Glenn went on to explain that this is why its so important that there is a group of people that keep their feet firmly grounded  peacefully  in the truth   It is important that culture is restored  truth is restored  and that we stick together and become a force for good ,0
Al Gore has been making the media rounds to promote his latest exciting book about the future or something  but his vision reeks of the disturbing science of eugenics  Yes  the science progressives of the early 20th century promoted that featured breeding undesirables out of existence  Al Gore is bringing it back On Morning Joe  Gore told the MSNBC hosts The scientists now know that there is in human nature a divide between what we sometimes call liberals and conservatives  and it gives an advantage  you can speculate  to the human species to have some people who are temperamentally inclined to try to change the future and experiment with new things  and others who are temperamentally inclined to say  wait a minute  not too fast Do you know what this is  Do you know where this philosophy comes from  Glenn said  I can take out the books  You know what  I wonder if I have them here or at the library at home  I can take out the eugenics books that he is quoting  he is quoting from right now  Whether he knows it or not  This is genetics  This is eugenics nonsense that was discredited in World War II  This stuff  this stuff is extraordinarily dangerous This is extraordinarily dangerous  This is the most dangerous  look  weve been talking about abortion  weve been talking about the sanctity of life  weve been talking about all these things  But Im telling you this is a gigantic warning sign  Because now youre  now youre taking it on political philosophy  And now youre saying that that is now genetic  and we all know  and what hes saying is that if you are a liberal  you want to  you want to push forward  But youre an Neander  you are born and termed at birth to be a Neanderthal and be a conservative and say you want to harm progress Listen what theyre doing  They are devaluing life  they are devaluing all life  You just had last week saying all life isnt equal  all people are not created equal  Already have that  Some people are worth killing  This is all the same eugenics stuff  And now youre born as either somebody who moves us forward or somebody who moves us back  When you know eugenics  when you know the history  you know that thats exactly how it started with Margaret Sanger Watch the video of Gores comments below Glenn went into further detail on this story when he came back at the start of the second hour of radio  Below is the transcript of that segment GLENN  I would like to be less definitive and more exploratory on this Al Gore statement that I find unbelievably shocking  He was on MSNBC and hes talking about the human makeup  and Im sorry but I have heard this language before  This is the language of eugenics PAT  Margaret Sanger GLENN  Margaret Sanger PAT  This is  and whatshisface  George Bernard Shaw GLENN  Get the George Bernard Shaw audio too ready  will you PAT  Yeah GLENN  If you dont know  the progressives are the ones who came up with eugenics  and you have to excuse some of them in the early 1900s because science had just  you know  in 1870  1880  you had people like Edison saying theres no reason to wire everybodys houses with anything but DC battery power  you know  DC electricity because youll never have anything in your house that is electric really except for lights  I mean  even Edison didnt see what was coming  Within ten or fifteen years  the whole world had begun to change and now there was science and thats where electric shocks came in  Lets do electric shock therapy  And you had Darwin and all these things were happening all the same time  And Marx  So you had Nietzsche  Marx  electricity  technology  Everything was changing and converging into one  So you had a bright  beautiful tomorrow  You had a beautiful better living through eugenics I have the books  Tomorrow  or I mean  next week well do a special show on this because I  you have to know this history  And in one of them by the guy who  Im trying to remember his name  Shoot  Its a phantom  the Phantom Public is the name of the book by Walter Lippmann  Walter Lippmann is extraordinarily loved by the media  He is the father of modern media  He was one of the fathers of CBS and CBS News  He was part of the Wilson administration  Really dangerous guy  He helped put together the Council on Foreign Relations  And in his book called the Phantom Public  he talks about people who are just too stupid and theyll never get it and they will never  they vote and they think theyre doing the right thing but they just dont know and its because  because of genetics  Genetics just show that theyll just never get it  and theyll continue to push us into the background But hes  he talks about how eugenics and scientists are now looking to ways to build the perfect voter  and someday well be able to weed out these genetic flaws in people and well have people who are all progressives  But in the meantime what were going to have to do is brainwash and trick some of these people This was the great hope of the progressives during the Wilson administration and the Theodore Roosevelt administration from the turn of the century up until it was wildly discredited by the Germans We also  Ill bring in next week  letters from the Nazis to the progressives in California saying  You brought all this progressive stuff over  you brought all this eugenics stuff  you guys  we cant thank you enough  May you never forget what youve done in Germany because you have now put the state on this track  and the things that were going to be able to do because of what you taught us scientifically will never be forgotten  Oh  thats true  I mean  we even have  we even have signs that say Never forget They were responsible  It came  These ideas that happened in Nazi Germany came from the progressive movement in the United States of America  secondarily from the Fabian Socialists in England  It was a poison from the West that went east  And there are those who still believe it We had a  we told you a story of a big lefty in Salon that wrote just last week that all  all men are not created equal  All life is not equal  She said  Lets be honest  We all know that a baby is she said  When I was carrying my children  I always knew that was a baby in there  So lets stop this bogus argument  We all know its a baby  Lets just be up front and lets use the real argument  All life is not equal  That goes against everything that Americans used to stand for  But David Barton gave me an extraordinarily wild fact  Does anybody remember last night  I think it was 60  of the American people that voted didnt know that the Constitution was the supreme law of the land  this last November  In exit polls  60  didnt know  I mean  how do you win  How does America survive if you dont even know  not know the Constitution  not know that the Constitution is the supreme law of the land  That is terrifying  So not all people are created equal You now have the president through executive order doing studies on who should and who shouldnt have guns  Hes demonizing anybody whos on the other side  saying theres something wrong  and I will not have these people stand in the way of progress  Hes coopting and now controlling our doctors and our hospitals  They have a death panel  It wasnt in the healthcare bill as we told you at the time  it was in the stimulus package  They are right now having a hard time getting anybody to go on this death panel because those are the people who are going to decide who lives and dies  And if you have an attitude that not all life is created equal  if you are funding death camps by the name of Planned Parenthood  forget about your FEMA camp  Your death camp in America is Planned Parenthood  And youre funding it  When the world is going towards no value on life and when your world is going towards a place where its so egomaniacal  there is no one but them  No one but the individual  No one else matters  I want mine  Grandma  You had yours  I was promised this  When you have a world that is so inner twined and in five years from now you will not recognize our society  The beginning of the singularity is already here  The merging of man and machine  The merging of reality and total virtual reality  but a reality you will not be able to tell the difference between Stu  do you remember when I said to you back in the Nineties theres going to come a day where you wont believe your eyes because they will be able to make any image on camera  any picture  It wont matter  You could just  were there now STU  Oh  yeah GLENN  Would you agree STU  Oh  sure GLENN  Im telling you now you will not be able to tell the difference between virtual reality  real reality sometime down the future  probably within the  in the next ten years  That changes everything  All of this technology that is going on right now  do you know whos teaching ethics on technology  No  thats not a rhetorical question  We cant find anyone  Theyre not teaching ethics  When it comes to technology  theyre not teaching ethics  And so now Al Gore comes out and he says on NBC for all the world to hear  and if you know anything at all about eugenics  if you know about the early 20th century progressives when Hillary Clinton said she is cut from that cloth  I am one of the early 20th century progressives  all eugenics  all Marxist wanttobes  just theyre not Marxists  they just want the Marxist utopia without the revolution  Thats the 20th century progressive  early 20th century progressive  And theyre almost unanimously cheerleaders for eugenics and weeding out the week  If you know anything about that  listen to what Al Gore just said GORE  The scientists now know that there is in human nature a divide between what we sometimes call liberals and conservatives  and it gives an advantage  you can speculate  to the human species to have some people who are temperamentally inclined to try to change the future and experiment with new things  and others who are temperamentally inclined to say  Wait a minute  not too fast  And when these natural tendencies are accentuated with political ideologies or for that matter religious factions and the other divides that are sometimes used to  for advantage  then it can get out of hand GLENN  Can it  And then what do you do  So you are born just only able to understand the future or dragging us back into the past  And then people will put a label on that  Youll either go into religion or youll become a conservative PAT  Well  if youre one of those that are holding us back  of course youll go into religion GLENN  Yeah  Or conservative PAT  Yeah GLENN  Otherwise youre a Democrat  a liberal  and youre an atheist  Youre a scientist PAT  Mmmhmmm GLENN  Extraordinarily dangerous  Maybe Im reading it wrong  Maybe Im just reading too much into it  Maybe Ive read too much history STU  I found the story  the study hes talking about  This is  it comes from New Scientist  British weekly scientific magazine  The title  Two Tribes  Are Your Genes Liberal or Conservative  Delves into the research on the formation of political opinions  I remember us talking about the story when it happened because it talks about how conservatives are dogmatic  routineloving individuals while liberals come across as freespirited and openminded GLENN  Thats how they come across  yes STU  Yeah  According to the emerging data  political positions are substantially determined by biology and can be stubbornly resistant to reason  These views are deepseeded and built into our brains  Trying to persuade someone not to be a liberal is like trying to persuade someone to not have brown eyes  We have to  GLENN  Oh  lets  oh  Maybe we should get some twins STU  Then it goes on  dogmatic types  more conservative  those who express interest in new experiences tended to be liberals  A much stronger link exists between political orientation and openness  which psychologists define as including traits such as an ability to accept new ideas  a tolerance for ambiguity GLENN  Oh  my gosh STU  And an interest in different cultures GLENN  Oh  my gosh STU  People with high openness scores turned out to be almost twice as likely to be liberals PAT  Openness  How do you describe liberals as open to anything  Theyre not open GLENN  They are not open to  PAT   anything but their own opinions GLENN  You know  can I tell you something PAT  Thats it GLENN   Penn Jillette is  and Im sorry I keep talking about him but I find him one of the most fascinating men I know  Penn Jillette is just fascinating  When Penn Jillette and I met  and Ill tell you  I say this over again  I really respect him  blah  blahblah  but I think hes a bigot  Old information  Hes not  Hes not  Penn wrote to me last week  last week or a couple of weeks ago  Because we were  we have these fascinating  Id love to do a book just on our email exchanges STU  The Penn and Glenn letters GLENN  They are truly remarkable because Im trying to understand his point of view and hes trying to understand my point of view I think  And were coming back and forth and we have these just allday exchanges  Im not kidding you  one of them was just on that guy in Florida that was having sex on  pleasuring himself on a donkey  not in a  STU  Right GLENN  Okay  And thats how it started  8 00 on a Saturday  At the end of the day  we just kept going back  you know  about  you know  300 characters maximum and just keep going back and forth on it  Fascinating  At the end I kind of joked with him  I said  you know  I dont know if  I dont know if were closer or farther apart  Im not really sure  I have to digest this whole conversation over a very long period of time  I said  but then again Im a guy who would never be invited to your house  Going back to a reference that he said about the second or third time I met him at CNN and he said to me  you know  I said  youre fascinating  Id love to get together with you sometime  And he said  Id love to  He said  of course youre never coming over to my house  And he was serious  He said  you know  because youre a religious freak  And he said  Im never going to have you religious people over  He said its like  why would I put a poison in my house  And I was shocked  And I said  boy  I thought  I thought you were a lot of things but I never thought you were a bigot  And he walked away and weve always  we had for a while still a relationship but it was a weird relation  it was terse  He wrote to me and he said  I apologize that I have never told you this  he said  but you changed me  He said  yes  I used to be bigoted against religious people  he said  but youve changed me  Im not  He said  I apologize for all of that and I am sorry and I am trying to fight my closedmindedness on anybody that I dont understand or I dont agree with  He said  on all fronts  He said  so I apologize  And now hes become a really  a big defender of people who are religious even though hes not  And he doesnt understand it  Thats an openminded person  And Im sorry  that is not  he doesnt call people enemies  That is not a liberal  That is not somebody who says  You know what  Im somebody whos going to  you know  weve got to wipe these people out or weve got to find out if we can  no  I respect them for who they are  Everybody is different  And as long as we try to play nice and I dont try to shut you down or call you names  you dont do that to me  We all live together  Its like a family  Just  theres billions of us  You live in the house and you all try to get along  even though you dont agree with each other  We all try to get along  We dont try to wipe each other out  And I would never as a dad go and say to one of my daughters  Well  genetically  you know  shes born like that  She only believes those things and shes going to fall into a religion or shes going to fall into some  she will fall into some atheists  If Im a conservative  she will fall in with some atheists or she will fall into some liberals because she was born that way  you know  Oh  my gosh  What are we turning into   ,0

Glenn took a deeper look at the new gun laws passed in New York this week that are being called the most restrictive gun control laws in the country  One of the major components of the new law being that magazines are now limited to holding only seven bullets Whats interesting about this  Glenn points out  is that they didnt include police officers  So  theres no loophole for police officers So if your a police officer  you better arrest yourself  he added Another detail now being discovered in this legislation is that its retroactive up to one year  Gun owners are not simply grandfathered into these new laws  Essentially  one year from this week  you would have to get rid of all of the magazines you own that hold over seven bullets  If you dont  youre breaking the law So legally purchased items have now become illegal This is unconstitutional  Pat said  Say what you will about it  but its flat out unconstitutional Has there ever been a case of where you purchased something  and its now illegal  Glenn asked The only circumstance Stu could think of where law may have been enacted retroactively was car emissions regulations Just in case these regulations apply to you  here are the facts we were able to dig up on retroactive  ex post facto  laws in the United States Constitution Clause 3 of Article 1  Section 9 of the Constitution states that Congress is prohibited from passing ex post facto laws  The states are prohibited in clause 1 of Article 1  Section 10 This is one of the relatively few restrictions that the United States Constitution made to both the power of the federal and state governments before the Fourteenth Amendment  The case referred to in the rulings of many of these Supreme Court cases is Calder vs  Bull  In the case Justice Samuel Chase held that prohibition applied only to criminal matters  not civil  Four categories of unconstitutional ex post facto laws were established There have been cases where retroactive laws have not been held unconstitutional  These include restrictions on convicted sex offenders and sex offender registration  A domestic violence offender gun ban was held up  where firearm prohibitions were imposed on people who have been convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence offenses and on subjects of restraining orders  Retroactive taxes are also not considered ex post facto laws So  while there does seem to be some disparity around regulations and retroactive law  it would appear that if you dont have a criminal background  laws that make something you own illegal when it was purchased legally are unconstitutional And they should be  As Stu points out  responsible  law abiding gun owners are some of the most serious about gun crime  They want people to abide by the law The most serious people on gun safety  and the people most serious about punishing offenders  of gun crime  are the people that I know in the N R A  Glenn added Glenn noted the biggest applause lines he gets when giving speeches at the N R A  are when he discusses punishing and stopping offenders of gun crime Theyre responsible with their guns  They know the meaning of a gun  And yet  theyre made to look like the monsters  Glenn said The people the laws would target  especially retroactive laws  are not criminals  Theyre not the people committing gun crimes  Theyre responsible law abiding citizens that have followed all of the laws Despite the unconstitutionality of the new laws  theres another issue  Nobody knows how many magazines a person has Do you announce what magazines you have Do you just destroy the magazines that you have  Glenn asked Its hard to believe that responsible gun owners will be reporting and handing over magazines they purchased legally  There is no reason to turn a law abiding citizen into a criminal or to make them feel like a criminal  Like youll see in the video below  there are legitimate reasons that both Democrats and Republicans should be able to see eye to eye on when it comes to gun ownership and the rights of law abiding American citizens   ,0
UPDATED  The New York StateAssemblyvoted for sweeping gun control measures Tuesday afternoon  making New York the first state to pass anti gun legislation post Sandy Hook Shocked  The New York State Senate was the first to pass a series of new reforms and regulations in the wake of the shooting at Sandy Hook elementary  The new laws ban any magazine from having over seven rounds  conduct real time background checks  alert police of high volume buyers  and broadens the definition of assault weapons  What did Glenn think of the new laws The toughest gun control laws now in the country  what a surprise  coming from New York  Glenn said on radio this morning He took issue with several pieces of the bill  including the reduction of magazine size from ten to seven  But as Glenn pointed out  most manufacturers dont make seven shot magazine rounds so the magazine capacity in New York has pretty much been cut in half I find this all nonsensical  And none of this would have saved the kids  Glenn said The NRA has called the legislation radical and in a statement said  The Second Amendment and legislative procedure became the sacrificial lamb in New York as Governor Andrew Cuomos quest for headline grabbing gun control was rammed through the Senate in the dark of night The New York Post put together a comprehensive analysis of the new gun laws It would create a more powerful tool to require the reporting of mentally ill people who say they intend to use a gun illegally and would address the unsafe storage of guns  the governor confirmed Under current state law  assault weapons are defined by having two military rifle features spelled out in the law  The proposal would reduce that to one feature and include the popular pistol grip Private sales of assault weapons to someone other than an immediate family would be subject to a background check through a dealer  Also Internet sales of assault weapons would be banned  and failing to safely store a weapon could be subject to a misdemeanor charge Ammunition magazines would be restricted to seven bullets  from the current 10  and current owners of higher capacity magazines would have a year to sell them out of state  An owner caught at home with eight or more bullets in a magazine could face a misdemeanor charge In another provision  a therapist who believes a mental health patient made a credible threat to use a gun illegally would be required to report the incident to a mental health director who would have to report serious threats to the state Department of Criminal Justice Services  A patients gun could be taken from him or her The legislation also increases sentences for gun crimes including the shooting of a first responder that Cuomo called the Webster provision  Last month in the western New York town of Webster  two firefighters were killed after responding to a fire set by the shooter  who eventually killed himself ,0
Glenn reacted to the various tapes surfacing of Alex Jones  who made a complete fool out of himself on CNN with Piers Morgan  Not only does he have insane points  the way he communicates them are 100 times crazier  which makes him the perfect candidate for mayor of CrazyLand   Yesterday we spoke about the media and hows the medias broken and I used an example of something that was happening on CNN on gun control   And its so clearly apparent what was going on   CNN Piers Morgan who is not a friend of the Constitution  not a friend of freedom as Americans have traditionally understood itHe comes over and he clearly has an agenda and that is to ban all guns  Glenn said So what does he do   He tries to make a monster out of anybody who believes in the Second Amendment and so he picks a guy  Alex Jones  whos easy to make into a monster and he picks a guy who he knows he can set off    Now whether you like this guy or dont like this guy is up to you   He has proven himself to be a dishonest conspiracy freak   I mean to the point  hes the guy who is  he is the author of the 9 11 conspiracy theory   Anyone who thinks that Popular Mechanics is a CIA front probably should  probably should get a nap in  maybe around 4 00 this afternoon Glenn explained that Alex Jones has a history of crazy ramblings and crackpot conspiracy theories  and the fact that he occasionally touches on things with truth doesnt mean that he is spreading lies and disinformation   I mean  even the devil speaks truth from time to time  Glenn said of Jones But they were going to try to make conservatives and gunlovers look crazy and look like something you should fear   He  Jones  did everything  Piers could not have done it better himself   He couldnt have hired an actor to  play Alex Jones and be better than Alex Jones was  if youre trying to do what Piers Morgan was trying to do But the craziness didnt end on Piers Morgan  Jones continued it on his website Glenn explained that he has received a lot of hate mail and attacks after criticizing Alex Jones on radio yesterday  but the hate only reinforces his point Now listen   If you ever  ever are a supporter of mine and you ever threaten anyone  if you are ever rude  I reject you   I have said this over and over again   If you are rude to somebody  if you dont approach them and just say  you know  I really think youre wrong and heres why  if you ever use any of the tactics of the left or this guy  I reject you   I dont want you as a fan or a supporter   This guy will never say this   And his supporters are over the top   Over the top Glenn warned conservatives and libertarians not to be swept up by Alex Jones just because he sometimes touches on truth  Because he points out the invasiveness of the TSA  it doesnt mean that the government was involved in 9 11 or that kidnapped children are being leased to corporations or any of the other craziness he spouts ,0
The radio station responsible for prank calling the nurse who was caring for Kate Middleton has taken drastic measures after that nurse committed suicide  The station has banned prank calls and has fired the show responsible for the bit  Will that solve anything  Glenn reacts on radio today Its a horribly tragic story  However  first of all  if youve killed yourself over putting a prank phone call to the princess of England  if you kill yourself over there  you have issues  Glenn said The criticism of the DJs and Im surprised how many conservatives are going to it  Its the Costas analogy  Well the deejays are at fault for this  Oh the guns are at fault for this  She had  I dont know what her issue was  Stu added Suicide only happens to gravely unstable individuals  The rrational mind  you have a survival instinct  Glenn said  He explained that a rational person would not think the world would be better off without them if they werent already suffering great pain and suffering ,0
Will an Obama victory mean a huge spike in gun sales  Thats the prediction that Glenn made on radio this morning before he interviewed David Keene  President of the National Rifle Association  Glenn explains hispredictionand talks to Keane about Tuesdays election and where Romney and Obama fall in terms of the second amendment Transcript of the interview is below GLENN  Im going to make a prediction  If Wednesday Obama has won the election  the biggest day of gun sales in the history of the world will be that day  There will be more ammunition and more guns sold in the United States than any place at any time in the history of the planet next Wednesday  And let me make another prediction  If Obama wins  you are going to be very angry that you didnt buy your gun in advance because theyre going to be hard to get  and ammunition will be hard to get  Because there will be a run on ammunition  Maybe Im crazy  but I dont think anybody  anybody who is an NRA member has any doubt on how much of a friend President Obama is to guns  and everybody will want to be grandfathered in David Keene  hes the president of the NRA  Hes with us  How are you  sir KEENE  Just fine  Glenn  Glad to be with you GLENN  Do you agree with the prediction that I just made KEENE  I sure do  You know  right after his election in 2008  because of his history and because of what he said during that campaign and because of what he said right after the election about wanting to reimpose the Clinton gun ban and tax ammunition and the like  gun sales went way up because people were fearful that he was going to go after their guns  And the same things going to happen now because even though for the last year and a half like most liberal politicians  hes tried to downplay his position on the Second Amendment  during that town hall debate he got a question  as you remember  and I dont think he expected it  But he came out of the closet  It was if he said  okay  regardless about what Ive said about supporting the Second Amendment  I dont  Id like to reimpose the Clinton gun ban  Id like to go after sidearms and when I get reelected  Im going to do it GLENN  You know theres  KEENE  So gun owners and everybody that believes in the Second Amendment who saw that debate knows that this is the same guy who campaigned against guns last time  who was an antiSecond Amendment activist back in Chicago  long before he ever thought of running for public office and that if he gets an opportunity  hes going to go after the Second Amendment GLENN  Let me  let me ask you this  Why is it so close in Colorado with so many gun owners in Colorado  Theres no ifs  ands  and buts on the friendliness to guns with Barack Obama  and anybody who says  Hey  transmit this to Vladimir  Im going to have a little extra flexibility after the election  thats frightening KEENE  You know they did essentially the same thing to Sarah Brady of handgun control  He told her  Right now  right now I have to operate under the radar  but Im going to deliver for you  Thats essentially the same thing he told the president of Russia  Let me get past this election and then watch my dust GLENN  Wheres Mitt Romney on guns KEENE  Hes committed to the Second Amendment  You saw that in the town hall debate  When Barack Obama said I want a whole bunch of new gun control laws  Mitt Romney came back and said we dont need any new laws  We need to prosecute criminals  we need to support the Second Amendment  Not only that but hes got on his ticket Paul Ryan who  you know  I thought about this the other day  Im a Wisconsin boy and I grew up about 15 miles from Paul and Ive known him for a long time and hes probably the most genuine outdoorsman nominated for either office on either ticket since the days of Teddy Roosevelt GLENN  Wow KEENE  I mean  this is a ticket that will be good on the Second Amendment and I think will be very good in terms of expanding the outdoor opportunities and the hunting opportunities and sporting opportunities for the American people  So I think theres absolutely no choice for anybody whos interested in the shooting sports or anybody who supports the Second Amendment or for anybody whos interested in being active in the outdoors GLENN  Yeah  I dont  I mean  you know  I know everybody makes the  you know  outdoor and the hunter  you know  claim but thats not why the founders put that in there KEENE  No  it is not  Its not the reason GLENN  Yeah KEENE  It was put in there  as George Washington said at the time  a free people ought to be armed  And  you know  Glenn  whenever I think about it  I think about a banquet that took place in Moscow a few years ago honoring General Kalashnikov who during World War II invented the AK47 and it was on the occasion of his 85th birthday  Mr  Putin got up to toast the general  Hes one of Russias few heroes  And when he finished the toast  General Kalashnikov got up  looked him in the eye and said  Mr  President  my dream is of a country like the United States governed by men and women not afraid of an armed citizenry Think about that  Most people in this world can only dream about the kind of country in which weve lived since the founding  And its that that distinguishes us from the rest of the world GLENN  Well  were sitting here now  were looking at Department of Homeland Security and everything else and we just take it at the airport  We just take it  When they come to our houses  youre like  well  what am I going to do  Because theyve lost their fear of the American people  And the more you regulate guns  the more we  I mean  the first thing that happened is whats happening now  We disconnect from the Constitution  We dont know our rights  we dont stand up for our rights  We dont even talk about our rights  We talk more about your rights than our responsibilities  and weve lost the founders understanding of the Constitution  But the only  the other thing is carrying a gun  having a gun  having a gun makes the government fearful of its citizens as it should be KEENE  Well  thats what the battle about the Second Amendment is really about  Glenn  Its not about crime  If it were about crime  then the folks who are antigun would look at the empirical evidence of  for example  the fact that in every jurisdiction that has allowed concealed carry  violent crime has dropped GLENN  Well  I mean  KEENE  They would realize that in those jurisdictions where guns are restricted  what theyve done is theyve disarmed victims and allowed predators free reign  Chicago being a great example  But its not about guns  its not about crime GLENN  Exactly KEENE  Its about the values that the Second Amendment and an armed citizenry represent to a government that does not believe people should have the freedom to make their own decisions GLENN  We have a  KEENE  Thats what its about GLENN  We have a real split in America  I mean  its amazing how half of Americas going one way  Id say even a third of Americas going one way and  you know  the remaining part of Americas going the other way  Today in Oklahoma  I think its today  you can now carry it openly  Now its not concealed carry anymore  You can wear it on your hip in Oklahoma KEENE  Well  there are a number of states where thats legal  49 states allow concealed carry in one form or another  Barack Obama has said in the past that he favors a federal law that would ban concealed carry in all 50 states  including the 49 that now have it  I dont know about the other seven  GLENN  Holy cow KEENE   that he has in his mind GLENN  Wait  So you mean that hes for the holster KEENE  No  hes not for the gun GLENN   Laughing KEENE  He doesnt  GLENN  Because Im okay with that  too KEENE  This is a guy who has said in the past  Glenn  that he doesnt think any American citizen has the right to privately own a firearm  He supported legislation that would ban the possession  sale  and manufacture of handguns in the United States  This is a guy who has been committed to stripping Americans of their gun rights throughout his entire professional and political career GLENN  But he is smart enough to know that hes never going to get around  and this is what people say  Oh  hell never get around the Second Amendment  Yes  he will  by doing things like supporting the 500  increase on the tax on ammunition and gun sales KEENE  Yeah  exactly  A lot of people dont realize that all of this is of a piece  If you increase the taxes on ammunition 500  1 000  whatever  youre making it more and more difficult for average Americans to own firearms and use them  to be involved in the shooting sports  defend themselves  You can do the same thing by taxing guns  as his former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel wants to do for gun sales now in Chicago and Illinois GLENN  And bullets KEENE  Do all of those things  or you can eliminate gun dealers  And hes been harassing gun dealers and reduced the number of them since hes president GLENN  Big time KEENE  Think about this  When the Supreme Court issued the Heller decision which guarantees the right to individually and privately own firearms and said that in the District of Columbia  because the original decision was about the district  that you have a right to defend yourself by keeping a firearm in your home  The District of Columbia government said  Okay  we recognize that  but youre going to have to buy it here in the district  The problem was there were no gun dealers that would sell to the general public in the district  And without the gun dealer  that right became an academic rather than a real right  There are all kinds of things  If you ban the manufacture of firearms  then what good does the right if you cant get them  In other words  there are a dozen  more than a dozen ways by bypassing the legislature  through regulatory harassment  through licensing  through executive orders  through a UN treaty that the president of the United States  if hes hostile to the Second Amendment and has a government that follows his orders  can get at the Second Amendment  And this is a guy who  if he can  will do just that GLENN  David Keene  president of the NRA  Thanks for being on and thanks for all of your hard work in this election season KEENE  Thank you GLENN  You bet  The NRA has done an awful lot in trying to get the word out because the Second Amendment is up for grabs  If this guy gets on again  mark my words  You better be at the gun store first thing on Wednesday if you want to be able to get one because they are going to go  they are going to fly off the shelves  fly off the shelves  Ammunition  And as he continues his second term with more latitude  you will find things harder and harder to get  If youre smart  you might want to  you might want to do it this week ,0
In light of all the reactionary  though hardly original  arguments being made in favor of more gun control we decided to post this chapter from Glenns book ARGUING WITH IDIOTS as a free download  Written in conjunction with Alan Gura  the attorney who won the landmark Heller case  the D C  gun ban  in front of the Supreme Court  this chapter refutes pretty much every dumb argument youve heard lately about guns ,0
Its the end of the world as we know itand Glenn finally isnt the only one saying it  Raoul Paul  who previously co managed the GLG Global Macro Fund and is a Goldman Sachs alum  has a pretty bleak prediction for what is coming to Europe and the rest of the world  What does he think is coming  The worst economic shock the world has ever seen and  even worse  theres nothing we can do to stop it See the Pals presentation HERE The world has no engine of growth with most of the G 20 countries approaching stall speed at the same time  Now  what is that  G 20  thats the 20 biggest countries in the world  Approaching stall speed  We have no engine of growth  Ask yourself this question  What is the engine of growth in the United States  Currently it is being set up that the engine of growth is the stimulus package  is the United States government  Is that real growth  I contend  and you know the answer  no  Glenn explained The western world is about to enter a second recession in an ongoing depression  For the first time since the 1930s  were entering a recession  Before industrial production  durable goods orders  employment  and private sector GDP have made back their previous highs  Hear that again  For the first time since the 1930s before weve made if back up on our feet  Usually we have a recession  it starts to grow again  and then we come back down  This is this is a new trend Fact  This will to be the lowest cyclical peak in GDP growth in G 7 history  These are the weakest ever foundations on which to enter a recession The problem is down to one thing  Debt This is significant  The 10 largest debtor nations on earth have total debts of over 300  of world GDP  History tells us that when sovereign defaults occur  what does that mean  Sovereign defaults  Sovereign default  if a sovereign default occurs  that means Greece goes out of business  Spain goes out of business  Portugal goes out of business  The Euro is a bubble  It will crash  Glenn said History tells us when sovereign defaults occur  they come in a series of defaults  We need to understand history in order to grasp the present  The domino effect  In history when you have a default  one falls into the other and the other and the other  So  he says  what is coming  EU sovereign debt defaults  UK sovereign default  Japan sovereign default  South Korea  sovereign default  China  sovereign default So  he says all of these will default and the biggest banking crisis in world history  Then hes got a few of the charts saying the end of finance  the end of Europe  the end of world trade  Then he has a picture of a hurricane and the eye of the hurricane  He says  We are here  We dont know exactly what is to come  but we can all join the very few dots from where we are now to the collapse of the first major bank  with very limited room for government bailouts Why is that  Do you remember when we spoke two four years ago now  maybe almost close to five  we said that there would come a time that these bailouts wouldnt work  that they would throw money at the system  and then I said  When they do this and it doesnt change any of the factors  they have to immediately shut the faucets off and go the other way  Otherwise  theyll continue to print too much money  theyll digitize too much money  Theyll flood the market with too much money and the engine will stall because you flooded it or you will have a rocket ship on your hands and you will have hyperinflation and youll have out of control interest rates eventually  With very limited room for government bailouts  meaning weve got nothing less nothing left now  Theres no bullets in the gun except meaningless printed  We can easily join the next dots from the first bank closure to the collapse of the whole European banking system and then to bankruptcy of the governments themselves  There are almost no breaks in the system to stop this and almost no one realizes the seriousness of this situation The problem is not government debt  per se  Listen carefully  The real problem is The 70 trillion in G 10 debt  the top 10 governments around the world  The 70 trillion is the collateral for  700trillion in derivatives  That number equates to 1200  of global GDP and rests on very  very weak foundations Imagine the UK defaulting  What do you think would happen to Japan and China  Would they not be next  And do you think that the U S  would survive unscathed  This is the end of the fractional reserve banking system and of fiat money  It is the big reset  This is what weve been talking about for quite some time  The big reset  This is what George Soros has wanted  the big reset When the system has to be rebooted  who are the players that are designing that  This is why when people say to you  George Soros  why would anybody want this to happen  Because if you know the reset is coming  anyway  if you know its unsustainable  then you want to be the one to design what the future looks like Glenn continued to read  From a timing perspective  I think 2012 and 2013 will usher in the end  You have to understand that the global banking collapse and massive defaults would bring about the biggest economic shock the world has ever seen  There would be no trade finance  no shipping finance  no finance for farmers  no leasing  no bond market  no nothing  The markets are  frankly  at a terrifying point of realizing that there is nothing they can do including quantitative easing to prevent this collapse  The next phase  as Spain and Italy go  will be to see nationalization of banks the nationalization of banks and the assumption of bank debts on government balance sheets  This is what we talked to you about on Friday  We have Tim knee Geithner coming out and saying  The governments have to take this debt on  Then expect to be shut out of financial markets  Bonds will be stuck at 1  in the U S  Germany  and UK  and Japan for this phase  The whole bond market will be dead  That means nobody wants to invest in companies  Short selling on bonds will be banned  Short selling stocks will be banned  CBS  banned  Short futures  banned  Put options  banned  All that will be left will be the dollar and gold  As defaults in governments and banks come to fruition  we risk a closure of the stock market entirely and a closure of the banking system as occurred in Argentina in 2001  Russia in 1998  and Brazil in 1999  We have around six months of trading in western markets to protect ourselves or make enough money to offset future losses  Spend your time looking at the risks of custody safekeeping  counterparty  et cetera  Assume that no one and nothing is safe  After that put your tin helmet on and hide until the new system emerges  I wish I could see another option with an equally high probability  but I cant find one  All we can do is hope that Im wrong  but either way  a new system will emerge and it will open up a whole new set of opportunities  but we are going back 40 years in time and 1500 to 3000 years in trading This  again  from not a schlub  This again coming on the heels of what George Soros said this weekend  George Soros said that he felt the EU had three months  Theyre saying the same thing Now  the question is  What do you do about it  What does this all mean  Thats what this whole week is about on the Glenn Beck Program and GBTV  Four steps  And I want you to seriously consider them with your family  I want you to seriously consider actually getting involved more than you already are  Glenn said  I promise you by the end of the week that you will see that there is a way out and all you have to do is not panic  The first step is to commit  not to tune out because you cant handle it  You can  you will  and youll lead the way out ,0

think of the latest attacks coming his way   Read the transcript below PAT   Rick  everywhere I go people are asking me is Rick Santorum going to want condoms   Everywhere I go  thats the main question on their mind   GLENN   And the answer youll have us believe is no   PAT   Is that the answer   Is that the answer   GLENN   Is that the answer you have us believe   SANTORUM   The answer I have you believe is no   PAT   Really   GLENN   Now  SANTORUM   But ask Chris Matthews   Theres a secret plan   PAT   Uhhuh   GLENN   No  thats not a con  SANTORUM   That I really do deeply  I mean  this is crazy   PAT   Yeah   SANTORUM   I mean  we were talking about the Griswold decision which you know very well which was the precursor to the Roe versus Wade decision and judicial activism and  you know  the creation of new rights because the Court says so   And thats what Ive opposed and will continue to oppose   GLENN   Okay   Well  SANTORUM   In this country   GLENN   We hear your BS answer on the contraception   Now let me ask you this  because its all about the right question   Is it a states right to limit all private body parts to bowel and urination evacuation only   STU   Jeez   GLENN   Is that what youre going for   SANTORUM    Laughing   All I  GLENN   Are you going to rename Kansas City Vatican City   SANTORUM   Oh  my goodness   GLENN   Do you believe when it comes to language that America should be Latin only   PAT   Now youre asking the right questions   SANTORUM   Oh  now youre  PAT   Now youre pinning him down   SANTORUM   Youve pulled back the veil   GLENN   Yeah  I told you it would be tough   We see you squirm in there Let me get to some real  SANTORUM   I do support Englishonly but its really a ploy to get to Latin  just so you know   PAT   Uhhuh   GLENN   Yeah   PAT   Uhhuh   GLENN   Yeah   SANTORUM   Uhhuh  there you go   Once you start one  there you go    PAT   Slippery slope   GLENN   You notice he didnt talk about the bowel and urination evacuationonly   PAT   Yeah  yeah   He conveniently ignored that question   GLENN   He skipped over that SANTORUM   I skipped that   I skipped that  yeah   GLENN   Let me get to a real question here   You have  you have spent some money in your past  Rick  and you have also been for  you know  earmarks   You told us last time you were on  you explained the earmarks  you said that it was your duty   Well  you go ahead and explain it   Real quick  just try to do it real quick because I want to get to a bigger question   SANTORUM   All Ive said is that  you know  under the Constitution congress has the ability to appropriate funds and  you know  one of the  one of the things that was generally done and frankly was done for decades is that members of congress  you know  in working with their states would identify things that they would want to spend money on and money that came from my state  taxes that were spent that were going to be reallocated back to the states and the senators in congress in that state would make sure that they were spent in a proper fashion and not just given to the executive branch and let them decide where that money was spent   There was abuse  that abuse led to higher spending  and Jim DeMint who also did those earmarks  too  and I and many others said we should end that abuse   GLENN   Okay   Some people are saying that youre an economic liberal   And I mean  honestly just about everybody is an economic liberal compared to me now   I want to shut the whole  whole darn thing down enough to the point to where it doesnt  we dont become the Articles of Confederation but we still have enough government to be able to manage the country and stop all this spending because were completely out of money   Tell me about your economic liberalism   SANTORUM   Well  I propose  this economic liberal has proposed  5 trillion in spending cuts over five years  a balanced budget in five years  specific  as the Wall Street Journal says  nobody was out there working on entitlement reform   Well  you know  Glenn  thats where the problem is in this country   Its the whole idea that Washington has entitled you to certain things simply because you are here in this country and or you may be in a situation that requires some help at some point this time   That is the problem   We need to get Washington out of that business  get those  get those responsibilities back to the states and give them the flexibility to design programs  if they want to design programs  to deal with  to deal with these issues   So if youre looking for the person  the only person in this race and one of the few people who actually stood up when it  when we werent running deficits  when we werent in fiscal crisis as we are today and said  in the second oldest state in the country  Pennsylvania  as the youngest member of the Senate and talked about the need for Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid  these big programs that affect disproportionately seniors and I was leading the charge in all those issues   In fact Im getting questions here in New Hampshire   I cant believe youre out there talking about specific reforms to Social Security  and the answer is yes  I am   Why   Because we need leadership   And so if anyone actually questions my bona fides  dont look at  you know  a few earmarks here and there during my  what I believe my constitutional duty to represent the interests of my state  look at the fundamental reforms that I have been advocating for 20 years in Washington D C  before anyone was talking about them   GLENN   By the way  I just want to point out  I dont think its  I think its bona fides and not bona fatties unless that was a comment about me  Rick   Im just   SANTORUM   Did I say that   PAT   No   GLENN   No   All right   It sounded like it   PAT   Rick  we learned last week from the New York Times  GLENN   Maybe Im sexy   SANTORUM   Its that Latin again   GLENN   No  I know   It might be sensitive every time somebody says fatty   Go ahead   PAT   And we learned last week from the New York Times  and you just said the word   Entitlement   Now  we know thats code speak for your hideous racism   Do you want to explain why you hate all people of color   SANTORUM   Oh  my goodness   You know  GLENN   You know what  can you play this  I would like to hear this answer   Can you play this   I hate to bring this up on you  Rick   You know youre a friend but this really was  this really doesnt make sense to me   Do you have that audio by any chance   PAT   No   It was actually printed   It was the oped  remember  from last week   GLENN   No  no  the audio of where you said  you know  look  we want to make sure that we take care of all people but we shouldnt be giving  you know  black people a handout or  SANTORUM   No  no  no  no  no   First off  I didnt  I listened to that  I looked at it   I think it was one of those things where I sort of got my tongue tied there for a second and because I just  first off I dont think that  I dont believe that   But I do believe in the concept of what I said that we shouldnt create dependency  that we should create opportunity and  you know  Im  the more I look at it  the more I  and by the way  no one in the room  and there were 100 reporters in that room  came up to me with that question   I think it was  I feel to this day that it was simply just  you know  I started to say one thing and then sort of stopped and said something else   But the point is a valid point   The point is that we need to create a society of opportunity instead of dependency and I would absolutely encourage everyone to look at the work that Ive done when I was in the United States Senate in working with the AfricanAmerican community in the State of Pennsylvania and across this country  no Republican had more interaction and worked closer with the urban areas of my state  with the AfricanAmerican community   I got the endorsement of the Black Pastors of Philadelphia which is not  let me assure you  a conservative group because of the work that I did in the inner city in trying to  tried to help improve the quality of life there   And the idea that  you know  you make a little bobble with your language and all of a sudden youre  you know  youre someone whos insensitive or feels  or tries to stereotype blacks is an absolute absurdity and it simply is not what I said and certainly from my actions nothing close to the record that I have   GLENN   I will tell you that Im sick of even the pandering now of saying  Well  Ive worked with this group or this group   Its not that you were pandering but people that are pointing this thing out and  you know  I work with this group or that group   What difference does it make   We all need to work together   The policies are for white  black  brown  yellow   SANTORUM   I agree   GLENN   Purple  orange   It doesnt matter   It should be for humans   We are all helping humans and American humans first   I mean  thats just the way it should be   And I dont  you know  now Id be  now Ill be a xenophobist for saying that  you know  it should be Americans first Let me go to the reduction in the military and its connection to the private hill tear that is being created   Can you tell me anything about the reductions and the private military  the use of  SANTORUM   Well  when you say private military  Im not  GLENN   State Department  SANTORUM   It does  GLENN   Reducing the number of troops  SANTORUM   Private contractors   GLENN   Yeah  private contractors  reduce  the reduction of troops in Iran and using private contractors instead   SANTORUM   Right   GLENN   Taking the uniform off and doing it in a different way   SANTORUM   Well  again  I mean  weve seen this over and over as we originally entered Iraq  it was because we simply didnt have the military capability  we didnt have the force structure to be able to support the mission that we had and so we brought in a bunch of former  you know  former military  on a private contract basis to do a lot of the personal security for people in the country and the like   And now we have the president further now proposing reductions in the military  which is going to lead  as you mentioned  to further growth in these  in a variety of these companies that do private  sort of a private military   That is  thats not the direction we should be going   You know  we need to be very up front about our costs  we need to be very up front about the accountability of the people that we are deploying around this  around the world to defend our interests  and the less we have of the private military and the more that we have of our men and women in uniform who are accountable to the behavior  the better off we are   GLENN   Tell me about your  because this is being touted  your antigun record   SANTORUM   What   GLENN   You havent heard that one yet   PAT   You havent seen that yet   GLENN   Oh  thats everywhere   Youre antigun   PAT   Every time we talk to you  Rick  SANTORUM   Im  inaudible  with the NRA   Im an NRA member   GLENN   Yeah  but you can buy that   SANTORUM   Oh  yeah  sure   GLENN   Yeah  that and the Better Business Bureau  you can buy into those   For 50 bucks  they will give you an Aplus rating   Yeah  thats what they all say   SANTORUM   Well  call Chris Cox  Hes the head of the NRA   GLENN   Yeah  I know   SANTORUM   And goes out there and fights for the rights of gun owners on a daily basis   GLENN   I know   SANTORUM   We work with them very  very closely   Im as a leader with them in pushing forward   Heres the amazing thing   The guy who attacks me on this is Ron Paul   Ron Paul  if it was Ron Paul had his way  he voted against the most important gun issue in  well  maybe ever because it was a gun manufacturers liability bill   As you know  Glenn  there were all these trial lawyers were going out and suing gun manufacturers if their gun was used in the commission of a crime   Whether the gun functioned properly or not didnt matter   They were going to hold them liable for any damage that occurred from someone being shot with their gun   And literally manufacturers were going to pack up and leave the United States  which meant we wouldnt have any guns  there wouldnt be any guns made in this country or be able to be available to be made in this country and so Im one of the guys that led the effort to put a ban on these types of lawsuits that passed on a bipartisan basis   Ron Paul was one of I think three Republicans who voted no   This is the kind of  for him  which would have eliminated de facto  de facto eliminated  one of those Latin words again  de facto eliminated the  GLENN   Hes slowly working it in   He is a Papist  SANTORUM   Inaudible  the Second Amendment   GLENN   Hes a Papist progressive   He just throws those words in and before you know it  were all speaking Latin   I know   How long before you make us wear the hat and the shoes that the pope wears   PAT    Laughing   SANTORUM   Got to wear the red shoes  though   Got to wear those red shoes   Slippers  not shoes   Slippers   GLENN   May I ask you  SANTORUM   Slippers  you cant work and so were going to keep you in the house and keep you under control   You didnt know about all this  huh   GLENN   May I ask you  how much money have you raised since  SANTORUM   Well  weve got a money bomb going right now at RickSantorum com   Were trying to raise a million dollars here between now and the next few days to get us ready so we can aggressively go out and compete in South Carolina which is the next big primary after New Hampshire and so thats RickSantorum com if you can help   I can tell you we raised more money in the three days after the Iowa caucuses than I did in the entire year before   GLENN   Well  wait   Rick  I think you were  you were running your campaign off of candy wrappers   STU    Laughing   SANTORUM   Thats an insult to candy wrappers   GLENN    Laughing   I mean  thats not really a big statement there   SANTORUM   Yeah   GLENN   Youre facing  SANTORUM   Its true   GLENN   Youre facing Rick Perry alone who I think has  what   65 million   STU   No  I dont  SANTORUM   Well  reports are that I guess his  the reports says his following is like  he has like  3 million left in the bank or something like that   He  I tell you he burned through millions and millions in Iowa   We spent  30 000 on television in Iowa   GLENN   How are you doing in the polls in New Hampshire and South Carolina   Can you win South Carolina   SANTORUM   Yeah  absolutely   I think the last poll I saw  we were within three points of Romney in South Carolina   PAT   Wow   SANTORUM   And we were just down there yesterday  just made a little quick visit down there for the day and had huge enthusiastic crowds up in the upstate which is  you know  the conservative upstate of South Carolina  the Greenville Spartanburg area and well be heading down there first thing Wednesday morning and do the sprint   We feel like thats a great place for us to really make this a twoperson race   GLENN   I  SANTORUM   We need to get it down to a twoperson race and if we can finish very strongly in either first or second  a strong second in South Carolina  well turn it into a twoperson race   GLENN   I only have just about two minutes left here   Can you help me  not even that   Ninety seconds   How are you going to appeal to  because while youre not Mitt Romney and certainly not Newt Gingrich  youre not a libertarian   SANTORUM   Im not   GLENN   How are you appeal to the people that  like I really lean  I think Im a libertarian that leans more  you know  I believe in a little more government than some of the Ron Paul people do   How do you appeal to those people while not compromising your values   So what are the things that you can say to a Ron Paul supporters that they will understand that is true about you  thats not some campaign promise   Where is the libertarian streak in you   SANTORUM   Well  you know  if you look at  look at the  I go with entitlement reform   I mean  you know  welfare reform was a bill that I helped author and I was representing a state with  you know  with big cities and lots of folks who were dependent upon these programs and the second highest per capita population of seniors in the country and Im out talking about limited government and Im talking about removing entitlement   Im talking about  back in the 1990s talking about removing personal retirement accounts which is something that the Cato Institute was pushing back then   So I mean  I think youll find that I very much believe in free people  free enterprise and free markets but  you know  I do believe in a referee private sector and I do believe government has some roles for helping  for being involved in not just national security but providing some sort of  you know  basic safety net  particularly for those who are on the margins of society  it should be done at the state level  not at the federal level  but I do believe that government has a role to play in that regard to make sure that  you know  we have some basic transitional safety net or help for those  particularly those with disabilities  and its a little personal to me because of my own situation but its something that I think is an important safety net that has to be out there   GLENN   Gotta go   Laus deos   Yeah   You know what it  means   PAT   Starting already   GLENN   All right   Thank you very much  Rick   I appreciate it

RESEARCH A BLOCK  Linking the Nazis and the Muslim Brotherhood Jew Hatred and Jihad The Nazi roots of the 9 11 attack Matthias Kntzel  The Weekly Standard September 17  2007  Vol  13  No  01 Mufti and The Fhrer   The Nazi Islam Connection jewishvirtuallibrary org By Brad Wilmouth   February 27  2011 As the mainstream media have reported on the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhoods beliefs  failing to pick up on contradictoryclaims by its leaders that the Islamist group opposes terrorism  also ignored was the role that the Muslim Brotherhood has long played in fomenting anti Jew hatred in the Middle East  After Nazi Germany financed and helped build up the previously struggling Brotherhood in the 1930s and 1940s  the group disseminated anti Jew propaganda and inspired the kind of persecution that sent almost a million Jewish refugees fleeing violence  confiscation of property  and expulsion in Muslim countries between the 1940s and the 1970s  Some even estimate that the land confiscated from Jewish residentsin Muslim countries amounts to four times or even five times the total area of the state of Israel  A number of Muslim countries saw their Jewish populations almost completely erased  including Egypt where the number dwindled from about 100 000 Jewsto only a couple of hundred Even somewhat recently  Brotherhood leaders havemade such incendiary statements as praisingAdolf Hitler to declaring that Muslims should stop fighting each other and fight against Israel instead  As previously documented by NewsBusters  an interview on CNNs Parker Spitzer helped reveal the tendency of Muslim Brotherhood leaders to twist the meaning of words  as one leader claimed that the group opposes terrorism and violence but then suggested that Palestinian militants are not engaged in terrorism against Israel but instead resistance  which he rationalized  He also refused to give a straight answer on whether the group would support adherence to Egypts treaty with Israel But on the January 31  NBC Nightly News  not picking up on Muslim Brotherhood wordplay  correspondent Richard Engel claimed  The Muslim Brotherhood denounces terrorism  but supports Islamic law  is anti Israel  and opposes U S  foreign policy in the Middle East On the February 6  World News Sunday  ABCs Christiane Amanpour  having just interviewed a high ranking Muslim Brotherhood member  claimed  He told us the Brotherhood is not seeking the presidency or any cabinet position  and he says the Brotherhood accepts Egypts peace treaty with Israel Back to the Parker Spitzer interview  when EliotSpitzer asked if the Brotherhood had any connections to terrorist organizations  spokesman Mohammed Morsy claimed that his group opposes violence  We do not have any kind of relationships with any organization that is practicing violence  We are against violence  wherever it comes from  governments  states  individuals  organizations  This is not acceptable at all But  moments later  when asked about Israel and the Palestinians  Morsy justified violent actions against Israel as resistance by Palestinians  Morsy  We do not use violence against anyone  Whats going on on the Palestinian land is resistance  The resistance is acceptable by all mankind  and its the right of people to resist imperialism In the February 7  2011  article  The New Leader of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood in His Own Words  CAMERAs Steven Stotsky picked up on a translation of Mohammed Badies first public address after being chosen as Muslim Brotherhood leader in January 2010  Badie encouraged Muslims to stop fighting each other and fight against Israel instead The Arab and Muslim regimes  have forgotten  or are pretending to have forgotten  that the real enemy lying in wait for them is the Zionist entity  They are aiming their weapons against their own peoples  while avoiding any confrontation with these Zionists and achieving neither unity nor revival for their nations  Moreover  they are disregarding Allahs commandment to wage jihad for His sake with  their  money and  their  lives  so that Allahs word will reign supreme and the infidels word will be inferior Today the Muslims desperately need a mentality of honor and means of power  that will enable them  to confront global Zionism   This movement  knows nothing but the language of force  so  the Muslims  must meet iron with iron  and winds with  even more powerful  storms  They crucially need to understand that the improvement and change that the  Muslim  nation seeks can only be attained through jihad and sacrifice and by raising a jihadi generation that pursues death just as the enemies pursue life As he complained about the most recent negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel  Badie declared that Resistance is the only solution Stotsky also cited the Carnegie Guide to Egypts Elections as having related that Badies election was generally viewed as a victory for the Brotherhoods conservative wing and a marginalization of its reformist trend In the February 16  2011  article  Tariq Ramadan Obscures the Truth About Muslim Brotherhood  CAMERAs Dexter Van Zile recountedMuslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Yusef Qaradawis recent history of expressing admiration for Adolf Hitler Then there are the public statements of Yusef Qaradawi  who was twice offered the position of Supreme Guide of the Muslim Brotherhood and who is described as the movements spiritual leader or father figure  In January 2009 he stated that Hitler was a divine tool sent to punish the Jewish people for their sins  He also called on Allah to take this oppressive  Jewish  Zionist band of people  Oh Allah  do not spare a single one of them  Oh Allah  count their numbers  and kill them  down to the very last one   Qaradawi  who is mentioned nowhere in Ramadans piece  offered a prayer in the 1995 funeral of Tariqs father  Said Ramadan The same article also relatesGerman Professor and author Matthias Kuntzels contentionthat anti Jewish sentiment in the Middle East was fomented by the Muslim Brotherhood The Muslim Brotherhood was also responsible for stoking anti Jewish hostility  not just in Palestine  but in Egypt as well  Matthias Kntzel  author of Jihad and Jew Hatred  Islamism  Nazism and the Roots of 9 11  2009  Telos  reports that the Muslim Brotherhood was a driving force behind a shift in direction in Egypt from a rather neutral or pro Jewish mood to a rabidly anti Zionist or anti Jewish one  a shift that changed the whole Arab world and affects it to this day  This shift  Kntzel states  took place between 1925 and 1945 and was stoked by a 1936 boycott against Jewish business owners in Egypt organized by the Muslim Brotherhood  Kntzel writes In mosques  schools  and workplaces  the Brotherhood worked up the believers with the legend that the Jews and British wished to destroy the holy places of Jerusalem  tear up the Koran  and trample it underfoot   Page 21 In the January 31  2011  American Thinker article  Why We Should Fear the Moslem Brother  Karin McQuillan recounted What you havent been told is this  the Moslem Brothers were a small  unpopular group of anti modern fanatics unable to attract members  until they were adopted by Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich beginning in the 1930s  Under the tutelage of the Third Reich  the Brothers started the modern jihadi movement  complete with a genocidal program against Jews  In the words of Matthias Kuntzel   t he significance of the Brotherhood to Islamism is comparable to that of the Bolshevik Party to communism  It was and remains to this day the ideological reference point and organizational core for all later Islamist groups  including al Qaeda and Hamas What is equally ominous for Jews and Israel is that despite Mubaraks pragmatic coexistence with Israel for the last thirty years  every Egyptian leader from Nasser through Sadat to Mubarak has enshrined Nazi Jew hatred in mainstream Egyptian culture out of both conviction and political calculation  Nasser  trained by Nazis as a youth  spread the genocidal conspiracy theories of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion  making it a bestseller throughout the Arab world  On the Ramadan following 9 11  Mubarak presided over a thirty week long TV series dramatizing Elders and its genocidal message She later continued In the 1930s  the Third Reich poured men  money  weapons  and propaganda training into the Moslem Brotherhood  It was the Reich that taught the fundamentalists to focus their anger on the Jews instead of on women  By wars end  thanks entirely to Hitlers tutelage and direct support  the brotherhood had swelled to a million members  and Jew hatred had become central to mainstream Arab culture  Iranian Ayatollah Khomeini listened daily to the Nazi propaganda broadcast from Berlin by Moslem Brother Haj Amin al Husseini  So did every Arab with a radio  throughout the war  as it was the most popular programming in the Middle East  Thanks to Hitler  the Moslem Brothers enshrined anti Semitism as the main organizing force of Middle East politics for the next eighty years B BLOCK  Whats Past is Prologue  Brief look back in history at some of the bigger moments where Jews have been persecuted  expelled or killed the saddest day on the Jewish calendar  not welcomed back until 1650s 200 000 Jews  thethought was the

QUOTES If I am ever really in power  the destruction of the Jews will be my first and most important job  As soon as I have power  I shall have gallows after gallows erectedThen the Jews will be hanged one after another  and they will stay hanging until they stink  They will stay hanging as long as hygienically possible  As soon as they are untied  then the next group will follow and that will continue until the last Jew in Munich is exterminated  Exactly the same procedure will be followed in other cities until Germany is cleansed of the last Jew Adolf Hitler to Josef Hell  1922  pg

in the Hamas Charter  Selected Excerpts  Preamble Our struggle against the Jews is very great and very serious  It needs all sincere efforts  It is a step that inevitably should be followed by other steps  The Movement is but one squadron that should be supported by more and more squadrons from this vast Arab and Islamic world  until the enemy is vanquished and Allahs victory is realised Article Seven The Islamic Resistance Movement is one of the links in the chain of the struggle against the Zionist invaders  It goes back to 1939  to the emergence of the martyr Izz al Din al Kissam and his brethren the fighters  members of Muslim Brotherhood  It goes on to reach out and become one with another chain that includes the struggle of the Palestinians and Muslim Brotherhood in the 1948 war and the Jihad operations of the Muslim Brotherhood in 1968 and after Moreover  if the links have been distant from each other and if obstacles  placed by those who are the lackeys of Zionism in the way of the fighters obstructed the continuation of the struggle  the Islamic Resistance Movement aspires to the realisation of Allahs promise  no matter how long that should take  The Prophet  Allah bless him and grant him salvation  has said The Day of Judgement will not come about until Muslims fight the Jews  killing the Jews  when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees  The stones and trees will say O Muslims  O Abdulla  there is a Jew behind me  come and kill him  Only the Gharkad tree  would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews   related by al Bukhari and Muslim Article Twenty In their Nazi treatment  the Jews made no exception for women or children  Their policy of striking fear in the heart is meant for all  They attack people where their breadwinning is concerned  extorting their money and threatening their honour  They deal with people as if they were the worst war criminals  Deportation from the homeland is a kind of murder Article Twenty Two You may speak as much as you want about regional and world wars  They were behind World War I  when they were able to destroy the Islamic Caliphate  making financial gains and controlling resources  They obtained the Balfour Declaration  formed the League of Nations through which they could rule the world  They were behind World War II  through which they made huge financial gains by trading in armaments  and paved the way for the establishment of their state  It was they who instigated the replacement of the League of Nations with the United Nations and the Security Council to enable them to rule the world through them  There is no war going on anywhere  without having their finger in it So often as they shall kindle a fire for war  Allah shall extinguish it  and they shall set their minds to act corruptly in the earth  but Allah loveth not the corrupt doers   The Table  verse 64 The imperialistic forces in the Capitalist West and Communist East  support the enemy with all their might  in money and in men  These forces take turns in doing that  The day Islam appears  the forces of infidelity would unite to challenge it  for the infidels are of one nation O true believers  contract not an intimate friendship with any besides yourselves  they will not fail to corrupt you  They wish for that which may cause you to perish  their hatred hath already appeared from out of their mouths  but what their breasts conceal is yet more inveterate  We have already shown you signs of their ill will towards you  if ye understand   The Family of Imran  verse 118 It is not in vain that the verse is ended with Allahs words if ye understand Article Twenty Eight The Zionist invasion is a vicious invasion  It does not refrain from resorting to all methods  using all evil and contemptible ways to achieve its end  It relies greatly in its infiltration and espionage operations on the secret organizations it gave rise to  such as the Freemasons  The Rotary and Lions clubs  and other sabotage groups  All these organizations  whether secret or open  work in the interest of Zionism and according to its instructions  They aim at undermining societies  destroying values  corrupting consciences  deteriorating character and annihilating Islam  It is behind the drug trade and alcoholism in all its kinds so as to facilitate its control and expansion Arab countries surrounding Israel are asked to open their borders before the fighters from among the Arab and Islamic nations so that they could consolidate their efforts with those of their Muslim brethren in Palestine As for the other Arab and Islamic countries  they are asked to facilitate the movement of the fighters from and to it  and this is the least thing they could do We should not forget to remind every Muslim that when the Jews conquered the Holy City in 1967  they stood on the threshold of the Aqsa Mosque and proclaimed that Mohammed is dead  and his descendants are all women Israel  Judaism and Jews challenge Islam and the Muslim people  May the cowards never sleep Egyptian activists to form Nazi party  newspaper reports  By YAAKOV LAPPIN 05 26 2011 16 41  Jerusalem Post Al Masry Al Youm report says Facebook pages launched to attract followers  Nazi parties operated secretly in Egypt during Mubarak regime A group of Egyptian political activists have announced plans to set up a local version of the Nazi party  an Egyptian newspaper reported on Thursday Citing a leftist Egyptian news portal  the Al Masry Al Youm daily said that the partys founding deputy is a former military official  and that the party would be aimed at bringing together prominent figures from the Egyptian society The report cited founding member Emad Abdel Sattar as saying that the unestablished party believes in vesting all powers in the president after selecting him or her carefully  and that preparations are under way to choose the most competent person to represent the party Almasry Alyoum added that an Egyptian Nazi party operated secretly under former President Hosni Mubarak  whose regime prevented party leaders from carrying out their activities freely The newspaper said it could not verify the report  but said it found two Facebook pages that appeared recently under the title of the Egyptian Nazi Party  which have so far attracted 70 followers Members are increasing at an unexpected rate  and several people came to ask about the nature of the party and its plans  the report said The party has a one year plan to develop Egypt  unlike the marginalized liberal parties  which are like dead bodies  a source was quoted as saying The idea to start it came after some fundamentalist religious waves emerged  which  according to the source  created a state of chaos  and led to the burning of churches  the destruction of shrines and assaults on unarmed civilians Responding to the report  Dr  Mordechai Kedar  of Bar Ilan Universitys Begin Sadat Center for Strategic Studies  said Egypt was going through a highly turbulent period  adding that all manner of bizarre individuals were launching Facebook groups and attracting members Historically  he said  the German Nazi party saw three attempts to copy it in the Arab world in the 1930s in Lebanon  Iraq and Egypt  The Egyptian party of that time was led by former president Anwar Sadat  who went on to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1979 They were copying the extreme nationalism of Germany  before the Second World War  and before the word Nazi became a coarse word  Kedar said Irrespective of the unconfirmed report on the Egyptian Nazi party  Egyptian activists opposed to army rule in Egypt are planning to hold demonstrations on Friday  Kedar noted Egypt is a country of 85 million people  Some activists want a second and a third revolution  No one knows where things are heading yet  he said   E BLOCK  More of current days events  F BLOCK  Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat   it   wrap up     Weve talk about the bad  now lets talk about the good  people from different ethnic backgrounds  who did not sit  but stood as symbols for good  the righteous among the nations Leopold Socha lived in a poor neighborhood of Lwow and worked as a laborer for the municipal sanitation department in maintaining the sewage system  When the Germans occupied Lwow  Socha  horrified by the Germans atrocities against the Jewish population  befriended Jews who had been interned in the ghetto  After he decided to rescue at least twenty of them  he co opted Stefan Wroblewski  a Pole who worked with him in cleaning out sewage canals  into his plans  One night  as he worked in the canals during the Aktion in which the ghetto was liquidated  Socha noticed several Jews wading through the effluent  Socha allayed their fears  stopped them from heading toward the mouth of the riverwhich was swarming with large numbers of police and Gestapo agentsand proposed that they stay where they were so he could assist them  The sewage canals became the Jewish refugees hideout  and Socha  his wife  and the Wroblewskis met their needs from that day on   At the beginning  the hiding Jews paid their benefactors  but eventually the money ran out  and Socha and his wife continued to care for the fugitives and  together with the Wroblewskis paid for the food out of their own pockets Hiding in the sewers was very difficult and both the hiding Jews and their benefactors faced enormous challenges  Among the Jews was a woman named Weinberg  who was in the last month of her pregnancy  When conditions in the hideout caused her baby and her elderly grandmother to die  the rescuers went out of their way to bury them  Several Jews  unable to endure the harsh living conditions in the canals  perished after seeking alternative refuge  It was Socha and Wroblewski who found their bodies and had them buried Mrs  Socha and Mrs  Wroblewski provided the fugitives with clothing and  in a complicated operation  did their shopping  Socha brought the people in hiding newspapers  He also helped them keep their Jewish traditions  he brought them a prayer book that he had found in the ghetto area  and for Passover  he provided them with a sack of potatoes  The Chirowski family went into the sewers with their two children  aged 4 and 7  Keeping the children busy was not easy  and in her testimony to Yad Vashem  Paulina Chirowski told them stories and tried to teach her daughter as much as conditions permitted  They would spend time under the sewer grills  listening to the noises from the streets  Paulina Chirowski remembered how her little girl was saddened when she listened from below to the conversation between a girl and her mother  on their way to church one Sunday morning  as they were buying flowers  All Paulina Chirowski could do was promise her daughter that one day they too would be free  and that she would then buy her flowers On the day of the German defeat in Stalingrad and on July 27  1944  when Lwow was liberated  the rescuers and the survivors celebrated together at the Sochas home After spending thirteen months hiding in the sewage canals  ten of the twenty one Jewish refugees in the group survived Jozef Ulma was a farmer and lived with his wife Wiktoria and their six young children in the small town of Markowa in the county of Lancut  district of Rzeszow In the fall of 1942  while the hunt for Jews was going on in the entire area  a Jewish family from Lancut by the name of Szall came to Markowa to find shelter  When they asked Josef and Wiktoria Ulma to hide them  the couple agreed  and took them in along with two sisters  Golda and Layka Goldman  These Jews stayed on the premises of the Ulmas and slept in the garret of the house They never hid in particular  since all of them were busy helping to run the Ulmases farm  reported Stanislaw Niemczak  a neighbor of the Ulma family  Although the Ulma house was at the outskirts  the Jews presence on the farm was soon discovered In the night of March 23 24  1944 German police came to Markowa from Lancut  They found the Jews on the Ulma farm and shot them to death  Afterwards  they murdered the entire Ulma family  Jozef  Wiktoria  who was seven month pregnant  and their six small children  Stanislawa  Barbara  Wladyslawa  Franciszka  Maria  and Antoni  The eldest of the Ulmas children had just begun to attend classes in primary school ,0

Except for remaining in state inventories  these so called high capacity magazines  will no longer be available to Vermonters  effective immediately  Ordinary Vermonters will no longer be able to import these magazines from neighboring New Hampshire  where such magazines are perfectly legal  How Vermont will enforce this law to prevent a homicidal madman from bringing thirty round magazines into Vermont to do his worst  is not even questioned  but that is exactly who this feel good law is supposed to deter  Like most gun control laws  this law will only affect the law abiding  Still  the politicians will pat themselves on their backs and imagine they did something And they have done something  Theyve limited the rights of Vermonters and theyve endangered the innocent and the law abiding  All to no effect  This  of course  is what is called in psychology  magical thinking  Violent criminals and homicidal lunatics will still be out there  waiting to prey on the innocent  undeterred by this unenforceable law  After all  the Parkland school massacre was committed with ten round magazines Thanks to Governor Scott  Vermonters will now be denied the same tools that police and government officials see as ordinary and necessary to protect themselves It is standard issue gear for American police to carry AR 15s along with multiple 30 round magazines in their cruisers  These 30 round magazines that Vermont has now banned  are the same standard magazines that are issued to both police and various federal government agencies  Since we  the citizens  are usually the first people to encounter a criminal predator  before the police are ever called  dont ordinary individuals need as much firepower as the police  Isnt your life worth as much protection  Remember  we will likely encounter the criminal first  contact the police  and then the police will eventually show up  Sometimes to do nothing more than to draw a chalk outline around an unfortunate victim   The reality is that Vermont has decided that the police get the benefit of being protected by high capacity magazines while ordinary Vermonters  including family members of the police  are denied the right and ability to protect themselves from the same criminal predators walking the same streets that the police patrol  Do ordinary Vermonters face different criminal predators than the police  Will Governor Scott and the legislature promise Vermonters kinder and gentler criminals and madmen to go with their reduced capacity magazine law Although there is an exception in the law that grandfathers in existing magazines  the reality is that the Governor and the Vermont legislature have decided that only the police should be allowed the benefit of having high capacity magazines to protect themselves  The peasants  the people foolish enough to have believed Phil Scotts campaign promises  not so much Vermont  which has never even required a permit for concealed carry  has now decided to follow Governor Cuomo of New York and climb onto the slippery slope of gun control with magazine limits  This  despite the fact that for years  Vermont has consistently been ranked near the bottom of states for gun homicides  with virtually no state gun control laws at all  Yes  you read that correctly What lessons can we draw from the tragedies of Parkland  the Pulse nightclub  the Nice truck attack and the Bataclan Concert Hall attack in Paris  The police will not always be there to protect you  They may arrest the criminals after the crime  but they cannot always be there to prevent it Never forget  You are your own first responder  Mostly  the police function merely as your backup  Maybe theyre minutes away  or maybe theyre hours away  like at the Pulse nightclub  You cant know   Ask the relatives of the people who bled out at the Pulse nightclub while SWAT waited outside for three hours and then afterward was awarded medals for heroism The violent thugs against whom the police arm themselves rarely prey on well armed police  This is why most mass shootings occur in gun free zones One would be hard pressed to find anyone who has ever been in a shootout saying they wished they had brought less ammunition  Criminal activity is often a group activity  There are partners in crime  accomplices  aiders and abettors  and terrorist cells  Columbine had two shooters  San Bernardino had two shooters   September 11  19 attackers  And the list goes on Police carry extra loaded magazines on their duty belt for a reason  They lug around the additional weight because their lives depend on it  You need a standard 30 round magazine for your rifle for the same reason your pistol needs a standard 15  or 17 round magazine  More ammunition is always better  Once youre out of ammo  youre out of the fight Anyone who insists that magazine capacity limits will deter a madman bent on committing mass murder is nave  ignorant or else has an entirely different agenda  The perpetrator in the Virginia Tech shooting used two semi automatic pistols in his attacks  a  22 caliber and a 9mm  He also had as many as 19 magazines holding 10 15 rounds each  The perpetrator in the Parkland shooting used only 10 round magazines in his rifle  Proposals to limit magazine size to 10 rounds would have had likely had no impact at all on the lethality of these attacks  Nor will they deter a determined killer like the perpetrator in Nice  France  who drove a 19 ton assault truck into a crowd killing 85 and injuring 400 innocents Finally  its interesting to see how these same magazines and the weapons theyre designed for  are described by our betters in Washington  When the United States Department of Homeland Security buys rifles  assault weapons magically morph into personal defense weapons  even though they add full auto capability  And if that isnt magical enough for you  the dreaded high capacity magazine of gun controllers nightmares  now becomes the standard 20 and 30 round M16 magazine and Magpul 30 round PMAG  No mention of ten round magazines or high capacity magazines here at all  Sorry  DHS and ICE just arent interested  Why is that   Just the standard magazines for them  please Homeland Security must be defending a different homeland than the one Vermonters live in The calculus of human nature applies to limiting magazine capacity  If 30 round magazines are outlawed  only outlaws  and the government  will have 30 round magazines  Gun control measures restricting magazine size serve only to advantage criminals and put the law abiding into greater jeopardy If Vermont and other state governments wish to deny Americans the right to own and use the formerly standard  but now high capacity magazines  then perhaps Vermont law enforcement including Governor Scotts security detail  will lead the way and switch to ten round magazines Just to set the example for the rest of us Mark W  Smith is a New York Times bestselling

This is a relatively new question  other school shootings  like Sandy Hook in 2012  have involved children too young to have opinions But theanswer is no  once you enter the political arena  your views are fair game Democrats have perfected the art of using sympathetic public figures to argue for positions most Americans reject  then accusing critics of mean spiritedness when they disagree We saw that tactic in the Khizr Khan controversy in 2016  when a Muslim father whose son died fighting for the U S  blastedDonald Trump from the podium at the Democratic National Convention  When Trump responded  he was accused of attacking a Gold Star family Likewise in the gun control debate  where people who disagree with impassioned calls for gun control from some of the students who survived the Parkland shooting are being accused of attacking children Some of the responses to the students are  indeed over the top  such as conspiracy theories about whether some of them are trained actors  It is probably true that some are being coached or fed talking points  but that does not make their beliefs less sincere However  the fact remains thatmany of the arguments used by the teenagers are weak  or simply false Take Emma Gonzalez  whose gun control speech last week was highlighted by CNN  It is simply nottruethat it is harder to make plans with friends on weekends than to buy an automatic or semi automatic weapon  as she claims Gonzalez also blamedthe couple that thesuspect was living with for not taking away his guns when they knew he expressed homicidal tendencies  But they have said thatthey never saw the warning signs that others who knew him saw Or take one of the students who participated in the extraordinary White House listening session on Wednesday  who tearfully cited a false story that has been circulating on the Internet  thanks in part to Chris Cuomo of  factsfirst CNN  The story claims that it is possible to purchase an AR 15 rifle in five minutes  It was easily debunked  yetto the distraught student  it seemed very real His feelings are completely right  but his facts were completely wrong The students admirable passiondoes not make their views more credible  Studentstend to know less  not more  than other people on most issues  due to their youth and inexperience  They are also more susceptible to being manipulated by adults with agendas That does not mean they should be ignored  either  but it is appropriateto askwhether their highly politicized views are really the necessary consequenceof their experience as survivors The reason that question is legitimate is that there are students whose views are entirely different from those being highlighted by CNN  Buried two thirds of the way down an Associated Pressarticle titled  Survivors of deadly school shooting lash out at Trump  a student named James Ciaramello says  I mean  tighter gun control  its not gonna help  Theres always a way around it  Needless to say he is not being featured and fted by cable news Some other survivors of mass shootings also oppose gun control  They includeColorado House Minority Leader Patrick Neville  R  who survived the iconic Columbine shooting two decades ago  They also include U S  House Majority Whip Steve Scalise  R LA  who survivedlass summers mass shooting at a Republican baseball practice Those who survive such events are just as divided as the rest of Americans on the issue of gun control The idea thateven sincere critics of the teenage gun control advocates are attacking the kids is not only offensive  but corrosive to democratic debate We do a disservice to the children who survive such horrors by telling them that Americans who disagree with them are their enemies  We cannot protect them by protecting them from the truth A final observation  the White House listening session showed the wide range of views on this most difficult of topics  After years of being lectured about gun control by President Barack Obama every time a mass shooting happened  it was striking  and refreshing  to watch President Trump listen And it was inspiring to watch students  teachers  and parents listen respectfully to each other It was a model of civility to which we should all aspire Joel B  Pollak is Senior Editor at Large at Breitbart News  He was named to Forwards 50 most influential Jews in 2017  He is the co author ofHow Trump Won  The Inside Story of a Revolution  is available from Regnery  Follow him on Twitter at  joelpollak ,0
They run this risk via their in your face gun controlhubris  especially when that hubris is directed toward docile actors For example  on Monday Rep  Steve King  R IA  addressed Parkland students who want to raise the minimum age for gun purchases by asking  If you are a teenager   believe you wont be responsible enough to own a gun until 21  why should you vote before 21  That is a reasonable question when one considers that voting and owning guns are both constitutional rights  Yet the responses to his question varied between things too vulgar to print and pronouncements that his political career is overthat he is a pawn of the NRA and is going to be voted out office Or consider David Hogg  one of the most frequent spokesmen for Parkland gun control activists  He put out a PSA one week before the student march for gun control and asked  What if our politicians werent the bitch of the NRA  And it is not just the way he talks about the NRA  although that runs the risk of motivating the groups five million plus members to show up and vote  It is also the way he appears to set himself apart from other Americans in general Take his March 22 Axios interview as an example  In that interview he talked of how his teachers are very understanding when he has to skip school for gun control events and appearances  He even talked of how he was recently supposed to take a math test but just said  Nah  This gives the appearance of special rules for the philosopher king  rules and opportunities that cannot be enjoyed by others  One cannot be blamed for sensing a similar  conflicting set of rules in gun controllers from Hollywood and D C If  by chance  you still do not see the hubris  then look at Parkland gun control activist Cameron Kasky  who spends time rejecting the idea of arming teachers to defend students when he is not making fun of Americans abiding conviction that we need to be armed to repel a tyranny  On Tuesday he tweeted To all people who think they need an assault rifle  I can not promise this  but I truly do not believe the redcoats will be coming for any of us any time soon  Cameron Kasky  cameron kasky  March 28  2018 And we have not even mentioned how the gun control activists treated Sen  Marco Rubio  R FL  and NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch during the CNN gun control town hall It was just a few short months agoOctober 19  2017  to be exactthat Sen  Chuck Schumer  D NY  was urging his colleagues to drop gun control until after the November 2018 election  He worried that the incessant  post Vegas gun control push was going to hurt Democrats in the midterm elections Yet the gun control push from Democrats has only escalated since Schumer voiced his concerns  thanks to the Parkland activists and others Meanwhile  the NRA PAC took in February donations that were three times higher than it received during January  This could mean that people had spent months saving in a coordinated effort to give money to the NRA in February orit could mean that Schumer was right and all the gun control rhetoric is rallying Americans to the standard once more  And that standard is the Second Amendment AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
But this time they are not merely advocating gun control policies or limiting the sale of firearms in certain stores  Instead  they are attacking Americas gun culture itself  By gun culture  I mean the culture that appreciates the value of firearms  promotes the lawful use of firearms  and respects the constitutional right to keep and bear arms  Two different developments have occurred First  the Kroger retail giant announced that it was removing from its stores any magazines or publications that feature assault rifles  Kroger wasnt specific about which magazines would go  but that could potentially remove everything from Guns   Ammo to Outdoor Life  Kroger owns nearly 3 000 supermarkets and retail stores including Kroger  Dillons  Fred Meyers and Harris Teeter  Unlike restricting the sale of firearms to buyers 21 or older  this move attacks the very notion that firearms can be the subject of collecting  sport shooting  hunting use  and popular interest  In other words  it rejects the fact that reasonable people have a legitimate interest in reading about guns Second  YouTube announced that all videos that demonstrate firearms  promote the sale of firearms  or provide instruction on the assembly of firearms will be banned from its platform  That is a major change that will affect millions of gun owners  Gun owners often check out reviews and demonstrations posted on YouTube before buying a firearm  just like other consumers check out reviews on YouTube Its also unclear just how extensive the YouTube ban will be  I and many other gun owners sometimes check out instructional videos on gun maintenance on YouTube  Those videos demonstrate firearms and sometimes involve the assembly of firearms  Will they be banned as well  And what about gun safety videos  Hunting videos  Those too involve the demonstration of firearms  and they indirectly promote the sale of firearms YouTube has become a virtual public square where millions of Americans communicate with each other on a variety of topics  It appears that this public square will soon exclude communication that involves firearms in any demonstrative way Both of these moves are designed to inhibit the expression of ideas that is an important part of the gun culture in America  Our Founding Fathers appreciated the importance of an armed citizenry  Indeed  they declared in the Second Amendment that it was necessary to the security of a free State  But an armed citizenry requires a culture that supports the safe and lawful use of guns by a significant portion of the population  That culture is now under threat Kris W  Kobach is the elected secretary of state of Kansas  Prior to becoming secretary of state  he was a professor of constitutional law at UMKC Law School from 1996 to 2011  An expert in immigration law and policy  he coauthored the Arizona SB 1070 immigration law and represented in federal court the ten ICE agents who sued to stop President Obamas 2012 DACA amnesty  During 2001 03  he was Attorney General John Ashcrofts chief adviser on immigration law at the Department of Justice  He is also a 2018 candidate for the office of governor of Kansas  His website is kriskobach com ,0
He did this by stressing that the Parkland attack did not result from a lack of gun laws but a failure of government to do its job Martha MacCallum pointed out that the speakers at Saturdays march preached gun control while omitting any mention of the myriad government agency failures that may have contributed to the occurrence of the Parkland school shooting  She said  When you think about all the different places that failed  starting with Sheriff Scott Israel  with the FBI  with the local police who had been to this house 29 times  I didnt hear any of that this weekend during these very forceful demonstrations Kashuv responded Gun control wont solve this issue  Weve seen that we have to hold our government accountable  we have to  The main reason why school shootings continuously happen is that our government is not doing its job  Its clear that when the government does do its job these shootings dont occur MacCallum and Kashuv then talked back and forth about Sen  Marco Rubio  R FL  who is frequently lambasted by the student gun grabbers After standing up for Rubio  Kashuv returned to his central theme I did not see a single sign  at the march  that said  Screw the Sheriff or Screw the Broward Countys Sheriff Office  I did not see a single sign  We need to represent and we need to make sure that the government is held accountable  And we fail  we have to make sure that they are held accountable  We cannot allow the government to continuously fail and not enforce what it supposed to do Kashuv said we have to quit deflecting our anger and look at the authoritative figures who failed  The FBI  and Sheriff Scott Israel  and the sheriffs office  and the cowards of Broward  who did not do their job  They have to be the ones getting the blame AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

CNN reports that the students walked out for numerous gun controls  one of which was universal background checks It is important to realize that the U S  adopted background checks on retail gun sales in 1998  In fact  it is illegal to buy a new or used firearm at retail without passing such a check  Universal background checks are the same  exact checks we have now  they simply apply to private sales as well as retail  But a background check is a background check And guess what  Parkland gunman Nikolas Cruz passed a background check for the rifle he used in the February 14 attack  Yet students are walking out to expand the point of sale scenarios in which other would be gun buyers must pass the same check Cruz passed Moreover  CNN reports that students walked out in support of a ban on bump stocks  But bump stocks were not used in the Parkland shooting  In fact  bump stocks have only been used criminally oncethe October 1  2017  Las Vegas attack The students also walked out for waiting periods on gun purchases  he same waiting periods that already exist in California  where Elliot Roger shot and killed three on May 23  2014  in Santa Barbara  Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik shot and killed 14 in San Bernadino on December  2  2015  Albert Wong shot and killed three at the Yountville Veterans home on March 9  2018  and Nasim Aghdam shot and wounded three at YouTube headquarters on April 3  2018 The students are also demanding the legal age for buying a long gun be raised to 21  that firearm confiscation orders be enacted  and that high capacity magazines be banned Efforts to ban high capacity magazines are misplaced  at best  School gunmen do not gain an advantage via magazines that hold more rounds but via the fact that schools are gun free zones where defenseless targets are sitting ducks for a lunatic armed with any kind of firearm  regardless of round capacity AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

For those too young to remember  the rope a dope was a tactic invented and used by Muhammad Ali  It was a way he made his opponents believe he had no fight left in him so that they  in return  would punch wildly and wear themselves out Ali would back up against the ropes  put up his guard  and let his opponent land blow after blow after blow  The opponent  in return  would grow confident of victory and risk recklessness  The unacquainted sports fan would watch in disbelief as the great Ali appeared close to going down while the seasoned Ali fan eagerly awaited the moment when Ali would drop the charade and beat his opponent into submission The moment would come at the height of the opponents confidence  which happened to coincide with the point where the opponent had spent his energy punching an Ali who really was not that tired after all  Ali would then grin  start punching again  and win the match A better analogy for what President Trump may be doing to Democrats right now is hard to imagine After all  he campaigned against expanding background checks  yet he showed interest in Sen Joe Manchins  D WV  background check gun controls and asked Manchin to put them forward Trump also campaigned against an assault weapons ban  yet he asked Sen  Dianne Feinstein  D CA  to add her assault weapons ban to Manchins gun control bill Furthermore  Trump spoke in favor of national reciprocity on the campaign trail  stressing his conviction that concealed carry  is  a right  not a privilege  yet he rejected Rep  Steve Scalises  R LA  attempt to add national reciprocity to the other gun bills being discussed in the wake of the Florida school shooting The totality of it all makes Trump look like he is on the ropes and nearly finished fighting for the Second Amendment But we must ask ourselves  is Trump really done fighting  or is he just sucking in the Democrats  letting them grow overconfident of victory before unleashing a flurry that stops their gun grabbing plan in its tracks Gun control rope a dope AWR Hawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for the Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

On March 10  2018  Breitbart News reported that the Department of Justice was finalizing its bump stock ban  Itwill center on a redefinition of the term machine gun in order to allow regulatory action against firearm accessories that do not convert semiautomatic firearms in automatics In other words  the term machine gun will cover machine guns and non machine guns  conversion devices that turn semiautomatics into automatics as well as firearm accessories  like bump stocks  that do not On January 23  2018  Breitbart News reported that formerATF Gun Tech ChiefRick Vasquez warned that re working and re defining terms to achieve a bump stock ban will lead to other bans  He explained that ATF was  at that time  handling the initial phase of formulating the ban  He toldtheMilitary Arms Channelthe ban would be a regulation with the strength of a law  He said it will ban any device that automatically resets a firearm and enhances the rate of fire  and warned that such an approach would be extremely broad He observed  They are trying to target binary triggers   bump stock  devices  and other devices  but that is such broad language  can I take that to a Gatling gun   So now you start stretching this  new  definition  and who is going to decide what the  standard  rate of fire is Vasquezs warnings came roughly two weeks after Gun Owners of America  GOA  warned that the Trump administrations bump stock gun control would lead to other controls  They suggested that an ATF powerful enough to arbitrarily redefine words so as to ban legal firearm accessories is an ATF that will not stop with bump stocks  They predicted that another crisis could lead to another redefinition which would allow the ATF to swoop in for magazines and aftermarket triggers too GOA executive director Erich Pratt told Breitbart News GOAis committed to fighting any regulation or ban on bump stocks  This issue goes far beyond stocks  because regulating devices that allegedly increase the rate of fire of a firearm can eventually be applied to match triggers  magazinesor semi automatic firearms  In essence  a bump stock ban opens the door to regulate and ban commonly owned firearms and firearm parts  A ban on bump stocks would have huge implications for the exercise of our gun rights  and that is why GOA is already looking ahead to a lawsuit challenging the regulation GOA is pledging to file a lawsuit against bump stock gun control as soon as it is enacted AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
Trump has spoken favorably of numerous gun controls since the February 14 Florida school shooting  One of his central gun control suggestions has been to raise the minimum age for rifle purchases from 18 yearsto 21 years of age  The NRA opposes this gun control  as does the National Shooting Sports Foundation NSSF NSSF deftly explained that natural rightslike the right to keep and bear armsflow from God  not from government  Therefore  those rights fall outside of governments purview  Because of this  the constitution does not give the government authority to restrict natural rights But Rivera wants Trump to secure gun control anyway and he believes that Trump is only person who can get it done It's like a tug of war for the soul of  POTUS on  GunControl  NRA   its supporters VS kids of  Parkland   theirs including me 1st one side has the upper hand  then the other realDonaldTrump is the only political force in the nation who can stand up to the implacable gun lobby  Geraldo Rivera  GeraldoRivera  March 2  2018 Ironically  it was Rivera who initially suggested raising the minimum age for certain rifle purchases  On February 20 the Washington Post reported  During dinner with television commentator Geraldo Rivera at Trumps Mar a Lago Club in Palm Beach  the president listened with interest as Rivera suggested raising the minimum age at which a person could buy a semiautomatic weapon from 18 to 21 In the days since Riveras suggestion Trump has made clear that he and the NRA do not agree on raising the age restriction  but he says there is no reason to fear the NRA AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

Manchin tripped over himself while describing the bill  inasmuch as he said the law abiding gun owner will not sell their gun to strangers or criminals or terrorists  Yet he wants more gun control over sales from law abiding gun owners anyway The bill being pushed by Manchin is the same gun control bill he and Sen  Pat Toomey  R PA  unsuccessfully pushed in 2013  The bill outlaws private gun sales  puts new regulations on gun shows  and would require background checks for gun sales resulting from classified ads Manchin tried to shift attention away from the gun control aspects of his bill by telling Face the Nation viewers that his bill is gun sense not gun control The irony of Manchins gun control push is that his bill would not have prevented the Florida school shooting  just as it would not have stopped the Sandy Hook Elementary School attack  Yet he is pushing it as necessary to close loopholes in the Second Amendment AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

While the overarching thrust of the Times article is to suggest the NRA used to be bipartisan  it actually succeeds in confirming that the Democrats embraced gun control in 1994 and never looked back The Times reports that the NRA gave 37  of its congressional campaign donations to Democrats during the 1992 election cycle  Two years later  the Democrats rammed an assault weapons ban through Congress and the NRA adjusted future campaign contributions accordingly In the fall of 1994  the Democratic controlled Congress  with staunch opposition from the NRA  narrowly passed a 10 year federal ban on assault weapons  In the two year period leading up to the vote on the issue  the NRA increased its contributions to Republicans by about  675 000 while reducing contributions to Democrats by nearly  200 000  It was the groups largest single cycle  or two year  dip in donations to Democrats In 2016 the NRA only gave Democrats 1  of congressional campaign donations Since 1994 the Democrats have been the party of gun control  Because of this  they have literally been a party at war with the NRA and the Second Amendment  Sens  Dianne Feinstein  D CA  Chuck Schumer  D NY  Chris Murphy  D CT  Richard Blumenthal  D CT  Joe Manchin  D WV  former President Barack Obama  2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton  and others in the party have emerged as mouthpieces for the gun control movement On the other hand  the Times describes the Republican Party as implacably opposed to gun regulations  But there are exceptions  Rep  Brian Mast  R FL  is pushing to end the sale of AR 15s and Sen  Jeff Flake  R AZ  is partnering with Sen  Feinstein to push gun control legislation However  even with the exceptions  the differences are starkone party is pro gun control while the other is pro gun rights  And the NRA is giving its money to those fighting to protect the Second Amendment AWR Hawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for the Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

Its too easy to get guns  first and foremost  When you can walk in somewhere and you can get one in 5 minutes  do a background check that takes 5 minutes  like how in depth is that background check  Those are the issues I have  Aldean told the Associated Press Its not necessarily the guns themselves or that I dont think people should have guns  I have a lot of them  the country rocker said  However  the facts dont support his claims The Parkland school shooter passed a background check to acquire his rifle  as did the Texas church shooter and the October 1  2017  Las Vegas attacker Moreover  the Alexandria attacker  June 14  2017  Orlando attacker  June 12  2016  theUCLA gunman  June 1  2016  the San Bernardino attackers  December 2  2015  the Colorado Springs attacker  October 31  2015  the Umpqua Community College attacker  October 1  2015  Alison Parkers attacker  August 26  2015  the Lafayette movie theater attacker  July 23  2015  the Chattanooga attacker  July 16  2015  the alleged Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal attacker  Jun 17  2015  the Muhammad Carton Contest attackers  May 3  2014  the Las Vegas cop killers  June 9  2015  the Santa Barbara attacker  May 23  2014  the Fort Hood attacker  April 2  2014  the Aurora movie theater attacker  July 20  2012  and the man shot Gabby Giffords  January 8  2011  all passed a background check to acquire their guns Many miss the fact that a background check is just that  a check that looks backward  It is done by the FBI and if there is no criminal history found  there is nothing to cause an individual from passing a check  Therefore  most public attackers are people who have kept their criminal records clear  And this allows them to acquire a gun just before they act criminally for the first time Breitbart News previously reported that background checks do not stop latent criminals  only actual ones On March 23  2018  Breitbart News reportedthat Aldean demurred when asked to address gun control  HetoldEntertainment Weekly Im not a politician  Im not trying to push my own agenda  If I say that I believe this  Im gonna piss off half of the people  and if I say I believe that  Im gonna piss off the other half  I have my opinions  but what the hell do I know He added  I think everybody needs to sit down  stop pushing their own agendas  and figure out what will make it safer AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

In remarks to NBC News on Thursday  Bill Murray wrote Youve got to surround a deeply political issue like gun control or a war  to come at it from every single direction  You cant just focus on one thing  or aim for just the one goal Ending the Vietnam war was not a simple thing  either  You had to make sure that all our people were safe  we had to make sure that they were as safe as you could be  And  you might remember  people thought it was going to be the end of the world if we lost Vietnam  But that war had to stop And now  well  Vietnam is one of the most wonderful places to go in the world  People love going there  they love the people  And we all survived  they survived  we survived  People will survive  If you can just stop shooting at them  they really do pretty well Vietnam did not become a land of sweetness and light because crusading hippies convinced America to end the war  Instead  Americas departure unleashed one of the most horrifying tides of murderous cruelty ever witnessed by the human race Bill Murray is not an oblivious twentysomething whose left wing teachers just kind of forgot to mention the killing fields of Cambodia when they taught him about the Seventies  so he should not need anyone to remind him of what actually happened  but here goes South Vietnam was swiftly overrun by the savage North Vietnamese after the American withdrawal in 1975  The good guys with guns left  so the bad guys with guns rolled in and started murdering people on an industrial scale Pound for pound  Vietnamese Communism was one of the most bloodthirsty ideologies the world has ever known  They managed to killten percent of the national population by the time they were done with their wars and purges The carnage was staggering  Up to 2 5 million South Vietnamese were marched off to re education camps  where at least 165 000 of them died of starvation  disease  exhaustion from hard labor  summary execution  and exploding land mines Another million South Vietnamese were thrown out of their homes to make way for the conquering Communists and forcibly relocated to areas so uninhabitable that a journalist described them as a prefabricated hell and a place one comes to only if the alternative to it would be death  Up to 155 000 of them died out there Another two million gun free Vietnamese decided to avoid the prefabricated hell their heavily armed conquerors planned for them  so they threw themselves and their families into just about anything that could float and set sail for Europe  America  and Australia  They were at sea for six months in some cases  facing everything from pirates and storms to malnutrition and disease Of the two million Vietnamese Boat People who fled the Communist horror  an estimated 200 000 to 400 000 died at sea or in refugee camps The Vietnamese Communists had a lively spinoff franchise in Cambodia known as the Khmer Rouge  managed by a fellow called Pol Pot  a Hall of Fame monster in the annals of genocide Two years after America pulled out of Vietnam  the Khmer Rouge overthrew the U S backed government of Cambodia A few days later  the gun toting Communists marched the politically undesirable members of their gun free captive populace into concentration camps even more brutal than those of Vietnam  or simply murdered them on the spot and shoveled them into mass graves There are individual fields in Cambodia where over 10 000 people were murdered  There is a concentration camp that took in 14 000 inmates  but only seven of them survived  The overall death toll from the four year Cambodian genocide has been estimated at 2 million against a total national population of just 7 million Here is a little irony for Bill Murray to savor  the Khmer Rouge leaders were highly educated student activists who were absolutely convinced they knew what was best for society  They were positively brimmingwith youthful idealism They told their critics  To keep you is no benefit  to destroy you is no loss So no  Mr  Murray  we didnt all survive Americas withdrawal from Vietnam  Peace and love did not blossom across the region as a result  And while Vietnam is doubtless much improved today over the first decades after the Vietnam War  and is becoming a significant U S  strategic ally against Chinas regional ambitions  it remains a Communist tyranny with precious little political freedom or respect for basic human rights Freedom of speech  opinion  assembly  and religion are highly restricted in modern Vietnam  Dissidents are harassed by the police  detained  and assaulted  Elections are even more of a joke than the one Russia just held  Human rights activists are detained to keep them from meeting with foreign leaders  Surveillance is pervasive  Members of disfavored religious groups have been forced to renounce their faith in public  Legal processes are dubious at best  Modest improvements are noted from time to time  but Vietnam has a long way to go before it fits any rational definition of a liberal democracy One of the biggest complaints lodged by Vietnamese human rights activists is that people like Bill Murray keep pretending the place is a reformist paradise where the commie stuff happened a million years ago  U S  administrations under both Republican and Democratic presidents have muted their criticism of the appalling police state in Hanoi as they seek improved diplomatic and economic ties  Activists have expressed disappointment in the apathetic response from the United Nations as well The thing thats so powerful about students is that  when you havent had your idealism broken yet  youre able to speak from a place that has no confusion  where there is a clear set of values  Bill Murray said on Thursday The thing that is so dangerous about the Lefts cynical manipulation of youthful idealism is that complex truth is replaced with simplistic fairy tales  symbolic gestures  and emotional appeals  If your clear set of values is based on deceptively edited history  then it is time to get a new set of values Bill Murray could start by apologizing to all the families he wronged by airbrushing the horrors perpetrated against them  brushing up on the real history of Vietnam from 1975 to today  and understanding how that history makes the exactoppositepoint about gun control than the one he intended ,0
Will other pro gun control Hollywood actors and directors whove used firearms in films for years pledge to lay down their guns in future films Its a question that could be asked of the likes of

The Associated Press reports that two states  Massachusetts and New Jersey  have banned the devices completely  Denver  Colorado  and Columbia  South Carolina  have banned them as well Bump stocks use the inertia of a firearms recoil to help fire the gun quickly  allowing gun owners to mimic full auto fire in short bursts  They were approved for sale by Barack Obamas ATF 2010 Crucial to the ATFs approval of bump stocks was the fact that they do not convert a semiautomatic firearm into an automatic one  Even with a bump stock attached  a semiautomatic rifle only fires one round with each trigger pull  Gun control proponents have muddied the water here by often presenting bump stocks as a conversion device  However  in reality  bump stocks were made legal for sale because they do not convert the firearms action Nevertheless  Massachusetts banned the devices  ordering residents to surrender them or face criminal prosecution  And former New Jersey Gov  Chris Christie  R signed a banon bump stock possessionas one of his last acts in office  giving law abiding residents 90 days to surrender their bump stocks or be criminalized  No example of the criminal use of bump stocks in Massachusetts or New Jersey was cited during legislative debate on the bump stock bans Massachusetts  New Jersey  Denver  and Columbia  moved to ban bump stocks after the public refused to support Democrat efforts against the devices in the U S  Congress The ATF is currently weighing whether to redefine the term machinegun in the National Firearms Act  1934  so as to cover a machinegun and a non machinegun at the same time  If they succeed in doing this  they will be able to use backdoor gun control to ban bump stock possession via regulatory action Gun Owners of America is leading the fight against the ATFs backdoor attack on Second Amendment  warning that a ban on bump stocks is easily broadened to include whatever fits the whims of the ruling class AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
That is because the government  in this case  public schools  made a special accommodation for a political viewpoint that it would not make for the opposing view  or for any other view A long history of First Amendment jurisprudence establishes that such viewpoint discrimination is impermissible The way to put schools on the hot seat would be to organize a pro Second Amendment walkout  or a walkout on various other issues Pro life organizations could organize a national student walkout on behalf of unborn children  for example  and dare school districts to provide equal support and funding to that which they provided for the national anti gun walkout   That ought to make next years March for Life  usually held in January  even more interesting School districts could argue that they were not discriminating among viewpoints  but rather expressing their own viewpoint  That it unlikely to pass constitutional muster  either  because schools are not supposed to be advocating for certain public policy issues  not to mention taking a position that arguably undermines a provision of the U S  Constitution But it would require the school districts to argue that the walkout was not student stagedat all  It would expose the fact that the walkout was largely run by national political organizations like Womens March and lobbyist groups like the PTA In any lawsuit  moreover  many school districts would likely have to face the fact that their participation in the anti gun walkout violated their own policies  That is not even a constitutional issue  but a basic administrative law issue  It is the basis for a potential lawsuit by angry Connecticut parents against theNew Milford Board of Education  for example What happened Wednesday was wrong  and no amount of Democrat media cheerleading can change that Joel B  Pollak is Senior Editor at Large at Breitbart News  He was named to Forwards 50 most influential Jews in 2017  He is the co author ofHow Trump Won  The Inside Story of a Revolution  which is available from Regnery  Follow him on Twitter at  joelpollak ,0

But we must face it Banning any particular category of firearms would not have done a thing to stop a determined  mentally unstable school shooter like Nikolas Cruz  He was so determined  in fact  that he stated his intention to be a professional school shooter on YouTube And while we would hope that agents at the FBI would have the intellectual rigor to put two and two together  or at least respond to a tip dropped squarely in their laps  there will always be the possibility they will fail  And while we would also hope that after responding to twenty calls involving the perpetrator over multiple years  local law enforcement would be able to do something  that is not always guaranteed either  Relying on government agencies to stop a shooter in advance is a dangerous approach  We should encourage law enforcement to try and prevent these incidents from occurring  but we would be foolish to think that that approach will always succeed When the government fails  as it so often does  the last line of defense is regular people with courage  At that point  the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun There was one person who displayed extraordinary courage at the Florida high school  Football coach Aaron Feis gave his life trying to shield students from the barrage of bullets  But imagine how much more effective coach Feis could have been in protecting the lives of students if he had been armed The time has come for schools to allow willing teachers  coaches  and staff to be armed  provided they obtain a concealed carry permit and take appropriate training The school resource officers who are present at some schools are not enough  The critical question in every scenario is  how long will it take for an armed defender to arrive at the scene  The answer to this question is a matter of life and death  If there are multiple armed teachers and staff in a school  then the response time can be reduced to seconds  rather than minutes This is not a new idea  Indeed  laws in 18 states already permit teachers and or staff to be armed in some circumstances  usually on terms that require the approval of the school board or superintendent  They are Alabama  California  Connecticut  Hawaii  Idaho  Iowa  Kentucky  Massachusetts  Mississippi  Montana  New Hampshire  New Jersey  New York  Oregon  Rhode Island  Texas  Utah  and Wyoming The other 32 States should amend their laws to allow willing teachers and staff to be armed  And those States that already permit teachers to carry need to revisit their laws to ensure that it is not too difficult for teachers who want approval to receive it  Thats what Alabama is doing  It should also be noted that in none of these states have there been any accidents or other negative consequences resulting from the policy of allowing teachers and staff to be armed The Florida Legislature is now considering a bill to join this list of States  If only Florida had taken this step earlier Coach Feis demonstrated heroically that there are school personnel who are willing to take action to protect themselves and others  It is time to let them do so with firearms Kris W  Kobach is the elected secretary of state of Kansas and a guest columnist for Down Range with AWR Hawkins ,0

Klepper is taking Thursdays episode of his show  The Opposition  out of a New York studio and into the living room of a private home in the Bethesda  Maryland area  Thats where many young people plan to gather in preparation for Saturdays March For Our Lives on Washington to oppose gun violence Its so nice to be inspired by people who arent cynical about the political process  who are actually doing something  Klepper said on Monday Klepper took a special interest in the issue even before he began hosting the weekday show  which airs at 11 30 p m  EDT  last year  He did reporting on gun control for The Daily Show and hosted a one hour investigative comedy special last June titled Jordan Klepper Solves Guns He didnt solve much  of course  But in the process of talking to people on all sides of the issue  Klepper said he was surprised by how much common ground he saw on issues like background checks and scientific research  To him  it has made the lack of political action on the issue despite several mass shootings particularly frustrating Klepper got some attention last month for having two student survivors of the Parkland  Florida  school shooting on for interviews The students are doing an amazing job of keeping this conversation going and elevating this  both in the news and in peoples minds  so it doesnt just go away and people in positions of power can forget about it as well  he said Show researchers found an organization called DC Teens Action  which is matching people coming in for the march with host families in the area  Comedy Central made arrangements with one such group to highlight for the show In addition to the young participants  U S  Sen Cory Booker  a New Jersey Democrat  will stop by Klepper wont be breaking character to conduct his interviews  He plays a conservative conspiracy theorist on the show  much like Stephen Colbert played a conservative talk show host when he was at Comedy Central He found that when he interviewed the Parkland students  they later appreciated Klepper going after them in this fashion  because it gave the students the chance to refute claims made against them The best thing that we can do is filter it through the resistance that they are seeing  he said  Its always a balance to play a character whos coming at things that are perhaps the direct opposite of the way that I would feel about them  But whats also refreshing about the situation is that they do get to push back against the trolls His show also will be filming at Saturdays rally for future segments Whenever you see an opportunity where maybe the conversation can change things  you have at it  he said ,0

Gov  Rick Scott signed a new gun law Friday  Parts of that law impose new gun controls  one of them raising the age to purchase a long gun  i e  a rifle or shotgun  from 18  as it is under federal law and across the country  to 21  Under federal law  21 is the age for purchasing a handgun  and the Florida statute makes it the uniform rule for all firearm purchases The NRA filed suit  arguing that this new Florida statute violates the fundamental right guaranteed by the Second Amendment  which provides  the right of the people to keep and bear arms  shall not be infringed In its 13 page complaint  the NRA argues that this Florida gun control violates the Second Amendment rights of law abiding and peaceable American citizens who are 18  19  or 20 years old  depriving them of their constitutional rights to obtain and possess firearms for self defense and other lawful purposes The lawsuit also includes an as applied challenge  brought on behalf of NRA members in Florida who are adult women under the age of 21  The NRA argues that data prove that women ages 18  19  and 20 are more law abiding and less violent than men who are ages 21  22  23  and 24 Therefore  the gun rights powerhouse argues that if Florida were to enact gun controls because of the violent behavior of young people  then it would make more sense to raise the age of eligibility on men to over 21 than to restrict adult women under 21  That being so  a uniform age of 21 is unreasonable  and should be invalidated The NRA is represented by lawyers from Cooper   Kirk  one of the most formidable appellate law firms in the nation  led by conservative legal icon Chuck Cooper from the Reagan administrations Justice Department under Attorney General Ed Meese  That firm has also represented the NRA in various cases nationwide  and is regarded as a group of legal experts on the Second Amendment and firearms laws and regulations In previous litigation elsewhere in the nation  Cooper   Kirk litigated on behalf of the NRA to have the federal law that requires a handgun purchaser to be 21 years old declared illegal under the Second Amendment  arguing that the age of 18 is required by the Constitution The case is National Rifle Association v  Bondi  No  4 18 cv 137 in the U S  District Court for the Northern District of Florida Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News  Follow him on Twitter  kenklukowski ,0

In a blog post  Citi group announced Under this new policy  we will require new retail sector clients or partners to adhere to these best practices   1  they dont sell firearms to someone who hasnt passed a background check   2  they restrict the sale of firearms for individuals under 21 years of age  and  3  they dont sell bump stocks or high capacity magazines  This policy will apply across the firm  including to small business  commercial and institutional clients  as well as credit card partners  whether co brand or private label  It doesnt impact the ability of consumers to use their Citi cards at merchants of their choice Bans on bump stocks and high capacity magazines have been a key demand of progressive gun control advocates  But whereas the usual method of activism has been to lobby representatives for change via the democratic process  Citi group is now imposing the change unilaterally  without asking their clients or customers Citi promised to respect the decision of clients that chose not to follow their guidelines  and work with them to transition their business away from Citi Since Donald Trump took office  corporations have been taking a growing role in public life  as progressive globalists try to use corporate power to advance their agenda  Leftist publications like the New York Times and Vox have gone so far to declare corporations the new moral voice of America  a stark contrast to the usual anti capitalist attitudes of the left But some companies are facing a backlash for their attempts to impose progressive values on their customers and clients  Lawmakers in George recently voted to scrap a planned  50 million dollar jet fuel tax exemption for Delta Airlines after the airline company cut ties with the NRA in the wake of the Parkland shooting  Virtue signalling can be expensive Allum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News  You can follow himon Twitter Gab aiandadd him on Facebook Email tips and suggestions toallumbokhari protonmail com ,0

Machins Senate career began with a 2010 special election victory in which he ran as pro gun and enjoyed NRA support  However  once in office Manchin expressed many of the same gun control views as Michael Bloomberg and spearheaded Barack Obamas gun control push following the attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School  PBSreportedthat the Obama White House trusted Manchin to beat the NRA on gun control To be clear  Manchins gun control support has paid dividend among leftists  For example  Bloomberg held a fundraiser for Manchin on July 22  2013  and Breitbart News reported that Manchin attended the fundraiser Yet while leftists were giving Mancin money the NRA was severing its relationship with him Moreover  the NRA ran an ad in West Virginia highlighting Manchins embrace of gun control But Manchin did not recant his gun control support  Instead  he made efforts to reinvigorate his failed Sandy Hook gun control package whenever afforded the opportunity  Following Pres  Trumps election  Manchin even expressed his hope that Trump could be persuaded to join the Manchin gun control campaign On April 7  2015  Breitbart News reportedthatManchin attempted to explain away the NRAs rejection of him by suggesting the NRA was no longer the group it used to be  He claimed the NRA used to stand for gun culture but morphed into standing for big business Now Manchin is running for re election in gun loving West Virginia and the onus is on him to convince residents that he pro gun despite being pro gun control  Doing that will require him to run as a pro gun candidate rejected by the NRA AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
Its been just over 2 months  David Hogg  a student at the Parkland  Florida  high school where 17 people died after a former student shot them  said in a now deletedtweet  We have walked out of school and now  on 4 20  we walk out everywhere  No matter where you are  if its home  school  or work  walk out  Gun violence can happen anywhere at anytime After learning of a letter written by from current principal Scott Christy and former principal Frank DeAngelis expressing the hope that Fridays anniversary would be about honoring the victims instead of protesting  Hogg took to Twitter to post another tweet and apologize  posting the letter with it Im sorry for my miscommunication yesterday I said that we should all walk out of wherever you are on 4 20 that was a mistake on my end and is no longer the case  Hogg said in a now deleted tweet  This is what the Columbine community would like to see on 4 20   DayOfService Some students at Columbine did take part in the first National School Walkout After deleting his tweets  Hogg on Monday issued two more We are still walking out however the Columbine community will be committing 4 20 to volunteering  Once again we are still walking out We are still walking out We are still walking out We are still walking out schoolwalkoutUS has been working incredibly hard on this  Hogg tweeted We are still walking out however the

working incredibly hard on this  David Hogg  davidhogg111  April 16  2018 Again the walkout is still on however the Columbine community will be committing their day to community service in remembrance of those they lost  Hogg tweeted Again the walkout is still on however the Columbine community will be committing their day to community service in remembrance of those they lost  David Hogg  davidhogg111  April 16  2018 Jason E  Glass  superintendent of Jeffco public schools  posted a letter on the school districts website about Columbines anniversary and the walkout Dear Team Jeffco  Public Schools On March 14  our schools successfully  and respectfully  navigated the student walkouts supporting the students  families  and staff who were so devastatingly impacted by the shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland  Florida  At that time  I also shared our desire and commitment  as a district  to meaningfully engage our entire community in the topic of school safety  As a first step  we hosted a community safety forum on March 20 at Lakewood High School  part of which included soliciting volunteers for a community safety task force  I will continue to keep you updated on the progress and recommendations of this group Given our own shared experiences  the events in Parkland  Florida certainly struck close to our heart  We are quickly approaching April 20  the 19th anniversary of the Columbine tragedy  Though we offer our heartfelt support to Florida  on this date  most of us thoughtfully reflect on our own history  In Jeffco  we have marked this time of year with positive acts  Columbine High School students participate in a day of service  doing volunteer work for a variety of community organizations and the entire district supports Day Without Hate  with events that promote inclusion and acceptance While the folks in Florida encouraged a demonstration of unified  national support through student walkouts  I request our schools and students consider honoring the memory of Columbine by following the lead of the Columbine community  which believes firmly in the motto  A Time to Remember  a Time to Hope  Coming together  giving back  and having a collective positive impact on our community has been a Jeffco tradition  and I hope we continue that tradition  My hope is if our students and staff feel the need to recognize the anniversary of the Columbine tragedy during the school day  it will be with acts of kindness and service in honor of the memory of those we have lost I know school violence elicits strong emotions  but our organizational commitment to educating the children in our community is paramount  As a district  we have a responsibility to acknowledge the political aspects school violence  to help our students learn about current events  and respectfully discuss issues  However  we also have a responsibility to be objective and refrain from taking a position on issues that may cause divisiveness in our community  I know this is a difficult balance  but I have faith we can be a voice of reason in Jeffco The National School Walkout website states National School Walkout is a movement powered and led by students across the country  Were protesting congressional  state  and local failures to take action to prevent gun violence  America is the only country in the world where so many people are killed by guns  and yet our leaders do nothing about it  In many states  its more difficult to register to vote than it is to buy a rifle  Apparently to some politicians  a vote is scarier than a gun The National School Walkout website is planned for 10 a m  Friday  The website shows walkouts taking place at hundreds of schools across the country Get your signs ready for Friday

Think about it  celebrities went gun control crazy following the October 1  2017  Las Vegas attack  Julianne Moore  Emma Stone  Melissa McCarthy  Adam Scott  Laura Dern  and others even took part in a Everytown for Gun Safety PSA  in which they urged opposition to proposed concealed carry laws as a result of the attack And celebrities called for more gun controlwithin hours of the November 5  2017  Texas church attack  Such celebrities included Sarah Silverman  Stephen King  Josh Gad  Chelsea Handler  Joy Reid  Adam McKay  among others Following the February 14  2018  Parkland school attack  celebrities came out in droves for gun control and they brought their friends  They expressed their solidarity with student gun control advocates  praised the idea ofa national march for gun control  and George Clooney  Steven Spielberg  Oprah Winfrey  and Jeffrey Katzenberg pledged  500 000 each to help fund the march Yet  after the YouTube HQ shooting what did we hear   Crickets Sure  actor Michael Ian Black blamed the NRA and called for more gun control before the facts of the shooting were known  Actress Alyssa Milano appeared to blamed the NRA as well  But these two proved to be outliers  The usual Hollywood suspects remained eerily quiet and a few  like Judd Apatow  just retweeted the crazy gun control comments Michael Ian Black was churning out Why the silence  After all  three innocents were shot with a firearm in an attack that seized the nations attention The answer is found by understanding the common denominators in stories onto which leftist celebrities usually seize For example  Las Vegas  the Texas church  and Parkland all feature white male gunmen  This fits well into the lefts lexicon and furthers their opportunity for discussing certain other political categories  like racism  white privilege  etc Also note that an AR 15 was used in Vegas  Texas  and Parkland  This  too  is a convenient fit into their assault weapons or assault rifle phraseology  and it furthers the lefts opportunity to claim that AR 15s have become the weapon of choice for mass shooters Then came April 3  and news began pouring in about an active shooter at YouTube HQ  A collective gasp filled rooms where celebrities sat and talked  as they waited to see if this would be the attack that finally put their gun control push over the top  But as they waited  the news faltered  The shooter was a female  Moreover  she was Iranian  And she used a handgun instead of an assault weapon It was learned that the YouTube HQ shooter had passed a background check for her handgun and had registered it with the state  per California law  Additionally  Breitbart News reported that California already has every law that has been proposed as a solution to the Parkland attack  including gun confiscation orders  but none of these laws stopped the YouTube HQ shooting So celebrities moved on  choosing silence over the option of drawing attention to a shooting that highlights the impotence of every gun control law they support  demonstrates the weakness of the claim that AR 15s are the weapon of choice  and deviates from their preferred category of white male shooter AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
Thursday on MSNBCs Deadline  White House  host Nicolle Wallace discussed gun control legislation on the heels of the shooting in Parkland  FL that resulted in 17 deaths  and asked when the Republican Party would wake up and realize it has blood on its hands Addressing political strategist Steve Schmidt Wallace said  You and I are the two non practicing Republicans in this conversation  and we carry the most culpability of a party being held hostage by the NRA  The NRA is a gun lobby that is out of step with the vast majority of its members that support more common sense gun measures  Most gun owners are for things like gun locks and gun safes  Most gun owners are for background checks She continued  I want to ask you something  Democrats who are for gun control are fine doing more for the mentally ill  but Republicans who are for doing more for the mentally ill never ever  ever  ever want to have a conversation about gun control  When is the Republican Party going to wake up and realize it has blood on its hands Follow Pam Key on Twitter  pamkeyNEN  ,0
The bill  AB1927  is presented as a way that people with suicidal thoughts can take away the option of acquiring a firearm with which to carry out their intentions The San Francisco Chronicle reports that Bontas bill comes despite the fact that California has a 10 day waiting period for firearm sales  That waiting period was ubiquitously put in place to prevent people from acquiring firearms with which to impulsively harm themselves or others  But Bonta pointed to a study which indicated Californians who take their own lives are simply doing so in the first week after the gun purchase is finalized Under Bontas bill  Californians who bar themselves from gun purchases would be able to recover their Second Amendment rights by demonstrating they were no longer a danger to themselves or others  He did not say what such a demonstration would entail Gabby Giffords gun control group cheered Bontas bill  saying  We support legislation that would empower people struggling with suicidal urges to promote their own health and safety in moments of calm and clarity by voluntarily adding their names to confidential gun background check databases for a temporary period In addition to a 10 day waiting period for gun purchases California has an assault weapons ban  universal background checks  gun registration requirements  gun confiscation laws  Gun Violence Protection Orders  a good cause requirement for concealed carry permit issuance  ammunition controls  and a soon to be requirement that all ammunition buyers pass a point of sale background check for a box of bullets  Despite these and numerous other controls  Bonta believes California needs another gun law AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

A similar approach  Operation Choke Point  was used by the Department of Justice during Barack Obamas second term in office and has been targeted for closure under the Trump administration On August 17  2017  Politico quoted House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlette describing Operation Choke Point as a misguided initiative  Goodlette observed  Law abiding businesses should not be targeted simply for operating in an industry that a particular administration might disfavor ButNYT saysbanks and credit card companies could continue such policies by simply banding together against certain aspects of the firearms industry NYT reports  PayPal  Square  Stripe and Apple Pay announced years ago that they would not allow their services to be used for the sale of firearms They floated this possibility Visa  which published a 71 page paper in 2016 espousing its corporate responsibility  could easily change its terms of service to say that it wont do business with retailers that sell assault weapons  high capacity magazines and bump stocks  which make semiautomatic rifles fire faster   Even the National Rifle Association has said it would support tighter restrictions on bump stocks They continued  If Mastercard were to do the same  assault weapons would be eliminated from virtually every firearms store in America because otherwise the sellers would be cut off from the credit card system The message is clearif Senators and House Members stand for the Second Amendment instead of gun control  then circumvent those Senators and House Members via a monolithic approach to banking that omits any financial opportunity related to assault weapons AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
The Smithsonian article opens by challenging a romanticized view of the Wild West  positing instead an image of cattle down after cattle town where firearms were heavily regulated It presents Tombstone as a case in point and set the background for readers Marshall Virgil Earp  having deputized his brothers Wyatt and Morgan and his pal Doc Holliday  is having a gun control problem  Long running tensions between the lawmen and a faction of cowboys  represented this morning by Billy Claiborne  the Clanton brothers  and the McLaury brotherswill come to a head over Tombstones gun law The laws of Tombstone at the time required visitors  upon entering town to disarm  either at a hotel or a lawmans office   Residents of many famed cattle towns  such as Dodge City  Abilene  and Deadwood  had similar restrictions  But these cowboys had no intention of doing so as they strolled around town with Colt revolvers and Winchester rifles in plain sight  Earlier on this fateful day  Virgil had disarmed one cowboy forcefully  while Wyatt confronted another and county sheriff Johnny Behan failed to persuade two more to turn in their firearms Next  Smithsonian explains that the gunfight at the OK Corral was a result of the Earp brothers seeking to disarm Claiborne  the Clanton brothers  and the McLaury brothers  They told the story as way to highlight Tombstones requirement to disarm but completely missed the fact that the impotence of the demand was evidenced in the cowboys refusal to do so In other words  while Smithsonian seized on Tombstones requirement to disarm as paramount  they overlooked thegreater point  Namely  that criminals had no interest in cooperating with it Sound familiar  It should  After all  the violence in gun controlled Chicago surged to such a level that it skewed national murder numbers in 2016  Chicago had a complete ban on handguns from 1982 to 2010  they have a violence tax  county restrictions on the number of federal licensed gun stores allowed  and  like the rest of Illinois  requirements that residents get a Firearms Owners Identification  FOID  card before being allowed to own a gun  The FOID card does not allow residents to carry a gun for self defense  they have to jump through another hoop and get a concealed carry permit to do that The point is simplethe vestiges of gun control are alive and well in Chicago yet violence rages  Just as we sawin Tombstone  criminals in Chicago do not place compliance with gun laws at the top of their daily to do list AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
To bolster this claim they published a proposal  circa 1989  and attributed it to Mr  Ruger via a link to a news storythat said Ruger execs were  at that time  expressing a willingness to limit ammunition magazines to 15 rounds  versus 20 or 30 The story provides no context for the proposal but does show that numerous other members of the gun industry were outraged by it The lack of context is exasperated by the fact that the February 9 NYT column goes on to use quotes from William B  Ruger Sr  and William B  Ruger Jr  interchangeably  seemingly unaware that they are quoting different people For example  they began with Ruger Sr s alleged 1989 proposal to voluntarily limit magazine capacity to 15 rounds and couple it with Ruger Jr s 1994 statement that certain magazines were only offered to law enforcement  They never differentiate between Sr  and Jr  and they omit Jr s unwavering anti gun control sentiment Case in point  they quote Ruger Jr s statement on magazines only offered to law enforcement but pass over him saying  The people who focus on gun control have got it all wrong  They are frustratedwe all are frustratedbut the quick fix they want just doesnt exist  They need to face reality  Criminals will always get guns  They also passed over his statement that America is a place of great diversity  and the gun industry is especially diverse and individualistic  People do their own thing  In any case  in this country you have the constitutional right to make a gun and to buy a gun  however its made  Thats not debatable The NYT also failed note Ruger Jr  saying  Of course were concerned any time one of our guns shows up on a crime report  But passing more gun laws is not going to stop such crime or criminals  As long as criminals are around  theyll have guns The February 9 piece rests on two statementsone from Ruger Sr  and one from Ruger Jr both of which are attributed to Ruger Sr  and both of which are presented while ignoring the overwhelming body of anti gun control statements made by Ruger Jr AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
The high school is located in Parkland  Florida  where someone opened fire at roughly 2 p m During live broadcast coverage on Wednesday  Sen  Nelson opened the door to a gun control discussion by saying  Each time this happens  and how many have happened  We say  Enough is enough  and then it happens again Smith responded  What could Congress do Nelson said  Well  we could not even  pass a bill  that would take the terrorist watch list and prohibit them a high caliber weapon or any weapon  We couldnt even get that passed  So when you say  What can be done  I dont know the answer to that Democrats pushed terror watch list gun control after recent terror attacksfor example  after San Bernardino  December 2  2015  and Orlando Pulse  June 12  2016 but it was defeated each time because the attackers were not on a list to begin with  thus the push was viewed as more gun control for gun controls sake Yet now  with the number of injuries and casualties inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High still unknown  Smith and Nelson and scolding Congress for not passing more gun control AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

Hogg made the comments Sunday during a gun control rally held atTemple Bnai Abraham in Livingston  New Jersey The New York Daily News reports that Hogg said  Im not going back to school on Wednesday until one bill is passed  He did not specify which law he wants most  only that he is not going back until at least one law garners the support of lawmakers He said  Literally any legislation at this point would be a success  Considering the fact that so few legislators in Florida met with us and they want the people to forget  thats disgusting  The fact that they want people to forget about this and elect them again as the child murderers they are  thats unacceptable and were not going to let that happen To date  state level gun control proposals include tougher background checks  a bump stock ban  a waiting period for long gun purchases  raising minimum age for rifle purchases to 21 years old  and gun confiscation orders similar to Californias Gun Violence Restraining Orders  All of these gun controls were proposedlast week by Florida Gov  Rick Scott  R  and not a single one of them would have prevented the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Proposed gun controls at the federal level include proposals similar to Gov  Scotts  plus an assault weapons ban and universal background checks  Rep  Ted Deutch  D FL  is a leading voice for these gun controls  even though neither one would have prevented the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting   The assault weapons ban would not have prevented the shooting because such a ban  if fashioned like the 1994 2004 ban  does not actually ban certain guns  Rather  it bans cosmetic features  And universal background checks would be impotent because the gunman  Nikolas Cruz  passed a background check for the rifle he used on February 14 The one change that could make an immediate difference in school safety would be to arm teachers as Utah did over 15 years ago  and as is currently being done in school districts in Colorado  Ohio  South Dakota  Texas  and other states  But David Hogg  Gov  Scott  and Rep  Deutch all oppose arming teachers for school safety Gov  Scott said we should rely on law enforcement  Deutch said talk of arming teachers is a distraction  and Hogg said money that would be used to arm teachers should instead be put into S T E M  studies so teachers can do more cool stuff and well be able to create jobs in renewable  clean and independent American energy like wind and solar AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
When we win and we take over in January  some of the issues that will come up soon are some of the issues that we are asking the Speaker to do right now  she said at a Georgetown University event Pelosi then said Democrats are set to push gun violence legislation and background checks legislation in addition to legislation on the Dreamers Certainly that will be among the things we will do right away  she continued Pelosi also suggested that Democrats would revisit President Donald Trumps tax cuts and push an infrastructure bill to build the infrastructure of Americahousing  schools  bridges  water She also spoke about building the countrys human infrastructure  including education and health care for young people and pension security for their families She said Democrats will run on fairness and justice and tell voters that Republicans in Congress have been there longer than President Donald Trump and are worse on issues left wing activists care about like gun control  climate change  and amnesty If Democrats do take back the House  Pelosi will not be a shoo in to become Speaker again  After Democrat Conor Lambs victory in a Pennsylvania special election  numerous Democrats across the country have distanced themselves from Pelosi  with many top left wing candidates even in her home state refusing to go on the record to voice their support for Pelosi Pelosi  though  is relying on her fundraising ability and political vote counting skills to regain her Speakership if Democrats take back the House in November ,0
He rose to speak after a gun control deluge from Democrat Delegates  which was combined with a blame game targeting Republicans Freitas would not have it  In fact  he offered a point by point rebuttal of the Democrat Party  their gun control aspirations  and the perilous position in which Democrat policies have placed generations of poor Americans and families from all socioeconomic backgrounds He introduced his comments on Facebook  writing  For several days now  some Democrats in the Virginia House of Delegates have made public speeches comparing those of us who take our oath to the Constitution seriously  to include the 2nd Amendment  to Nazis and segregationists He then launched into his floor speech  calling out Democrat Delegates who claimed they were in pursuit of an open and honest debate on gun violence  school shootings  gun control  etc Freitas said Im certainly willing to have that debate  and I think if we were going to look seriously at school shootings and gun control we would analyze things like  Why do all mass shootings seem to take place in gun free zones  Wouldnt it be reasonable to test whether or not  gun free zones have actually achieved what their  intent is We would start to look at why most of these shooters come from broken homes  What sort of government policies have actually encouraged broken homes He then pointed to left leaning think tanks that have found the abortion industry contributes to broken homes while conservative leaning think tanks point to the Democrat sponsored welfare state as perpetuating broken homes Freitas then suggested looking around the country at areas with the strictest gun controlmentioning Chicago and Washington  DC  among others  He said  For some reason   the gun control  hasnt seemed to stop the gun violence in those particular areas Freitas made clear that a debate on gun violence and school shootings should also include talk of arming certain teachers to keep students safe He said  Not every teacher  but a teacher that is comfortable with it  That is former law enforcement  is former military  that is now in the classroom  Delegate  Kenneth Plum  D 36  said yesterday that was ridiculous to consider  Why  Is that because the other side of this debate will only accept one solution to this problem  And that is tearing apart or gutting the Second Amendment Freitas suggested Republicans have learned they cannot trust Democrats on gun control  that one Democrat sponsored gun law always leads to another  and another after that  and still another after that He said I dont think any of us on this side of the aisle believe you when you say thats all you want to do  Itll be bump stocks  itll be background checks  then itll be a different kind of background checks that register the guns  Then after that itll be that we need to ban assault weapons  Whats an assault weapon  Something that looks scary  Then after that it will be semiautomatic rifles  after that it will be semiautomatic handguns  then it will be revolvers  and  shotguns  Because when the policies fail to produce the results you are promising your constituents  youll be back with more reasons on why we have to infringe on Second Amendment rights Freitas then took on Democrats who compared Republicans to segregationalists  He said  I just want to remind everybody  that it was not our party that supported slavery  that fought  against  womens suffrage  that rounded up tens of thousands of Asian Americans and put them in concentration camps  during World War II  that supported Jim Crow  that supported segregation or supported mass resistance  That wasnt our party  that was the Democrat Party AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
Delta was one of over 12 companies that ended their relationships with the NRA in response to an anti NRA campaign conducted after Nikolas Cruz passed a background check  acquired a rifle  and used it to kill 17 people in a gun free school zone The Atlanta Constitution Journalreports that Delta CEOEd Bastian said  Our people and our customers have a wide range of views on how to increase safety in our schools and public places  and we are not taking sides  Our objective in removing any implied affiliation with the NRA was toremove Delta from this debate But Delta found itself near the center of the debate when Georgia Lt  Gov  Casey Cagle  R  tweeted that he would stop tax cut legislation benefiting Delta unless the airline reversed its decision to sever ties with the NRA I will kill any tax legislation that benefits  Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with  NRA   Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back  Casey Cagle  CaseyCagle  February 26  2018 Deltas Bastian sent a memo to company employees that the intent was not to take sides  Bastian wrote While Deltas intent was to remain neutral  some elected officials in Georgia tied our decision to a pending jet fuel tax exemption threatening to eliminate itunless we reversed course  Our decision was not made for economic gain and our values are not for sale  We are in the process of a review toend group discountsfor any group of a politically divisive nature On March 1  Georgia lawmakers voted to do away with the tax cut that would have benefited Delta Bastian responded to the rescinded tax cut by stressing that Delta supports the Second Amendment AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
The two senators are sponsoring a bill that would make 21 the minimum age to purchase an AR 15  AK 47  or related rifle Flake explained the proposed gun control If the law says someone under the age of 21 is too young to purchase a handgun  than it ought to say theyre too young to purchase an assault weapon  This bipartisan fix is long overdue  and wouldve made as much sense before the tragedy in Parkland as it does after  I hope we can work together to get this passed and signed into law without delay Feinstein echoed him Under current law  licensed gun dealers cannot sell a handgun to anyone under 21  but they are allowed to sell assault rifles like the AR 15 to anyone over 18  This policy is dangerous and makes absolutely no sense  If you cant buy a beer  you shouldnt be able to buy a weapon of war  While we need to do much more to reform our gun laws  ensuring teenagers cant legally buy weapons of war is a commonsense step forward Flake and Feinsteins bill is in response to the fact that the Florida school shooter legally purchased his rifle at age 18  the same age at which our country outfits young men with fully automatic weapons and sends them off to war This gun control push is addition to Feinsteins other legislative push for an all out ban assault weapons  Sen Joe Manchins  D WV  push for new regulations on gun shows and private gun sales  Rep  Ted Deutchs  D FL  push to ban bump stocks  Rep  Brian Masts  R FL  push for Trump to issue an immediate  temporary ban on the sale of AR 15s  and Rep  Carolyn Maloneys  D NY  call to ban massacre machine gun magazines AWR Hawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for the Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

In the video  Hogg seizes on Trumps rope a dope of Democrats  whereby he made them believe he was open to every gun control imaginable  only to draw them out into the light and deny them every gun control they pushed  He then points to Democrat Conor Lambs victory over Republican Rick Saccone earlier in the week  Hogg suggests Lambs victory is proof Americans have had enough However  Hoggs summary overlooks the fact that Lamb won on a pro gun campaign  In fact  Investors Business Daily described Lamb as a poster boy for the NRA Lamb opposes high capacity magazine bans and reacted to the post Parkland school shooting gun control push by saying  New gun laws arent the answer to preventing more mass shootings like the one at a Florida high school Yet Hogg cites Lamb as proof that people are turning against Trump and the NRA WhatIf we could go to school without fearing for our lives  Join us on March 24th and visit https t co SrCltJsrBH  NeverAgain pic twitter com iXmCNFOrVj  David Hogg  davidhogg111  March 16  2018 Ultimately  Hoggs PSA contains yet another call for broader participation in the fast approaching student march for gun control The march has lots of leftist backing and big financial donations from celebrities  For example  on February 20 Breitbart News reported that George Clooney  Oprah Winfrey  Steven Spielberg  and Jeffrey Katzenberg are donating  500 000 each to the march Fox News Laura Ingraham watched Hoggs video and listened to him ask  What if our politicians werent the bitch of the NRA  She responded by saying  Your 15 Minutes is Up  Perhaps if one stayed in school  one would know to use the plural AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
In this weeks exclusive clip for Breitbart News  Jackie ponders the true motives behind gun control advocacy  and wonders when celebrities and politicians plan on getting rid of all of their armed bodyguards They dont care about protecting you  The only thing they care about is protecting themselves  says Jackie  Did you ever see in your life a celebrity walking around without being protected Whos more likely to get killed  a celebrity whos protected by 35 guards  or you when you go for a walk at night  Jackie asks  How come they have guards for them  You know what this guard is carrying  What do you think hes carrying  a pastrami sandwich  A cookie  Hes carrying a gun  So if a gun is important for him  how come its not important for you Jackie also questions the wisdom in raising the minimum age to own a gun to 21  an idea that has been proposed by gun control advocates You think before a guy tries to kill somebody  he says  Lets see  how old am I  Im 18  Oh  okay  then Ill wait a couple years  Maybe at 19 Ill try to look for a gun but I wont shoot anybody  Maybe when Im 20 Ill think it over  Oh  Im 21  Good  where can I go kill somebody now ' So what does this tell us  It tells us that every celebrity  every politician  and every preacher about gun control is a phony bastard  Jackie adds  Theres nobody lower than these son of a bitches who dont care about your life  and dont care if you drop dead by Thursday as long as theyre protected But Jackies not quite done there  He says the gun crime rate in strictly gun controlled Chicago proves that attempting to control criminal behavior with new laws is pointless Youre not allowed to touch a gun  carry a gun  look at a gun  or even find out about a gun  Ten minutes later  they kill everybody  Jackie says  The highest percentage of murders in the country is in Chicago  You know what that says  That says if youre in favor of gun control  youre full of sh t Watch Jackies latest above ,0
Similar claims have been made by gun controllers for years  and have been debunked at every turn For example  gun controllers claimed 355 mass shootings for the year 2015  prompting Mother Jones editor Mark Follman to counter that the number of mass shootings was actually four In other words  gun controllers were swelling the actual number of mass shootings by 351 for that year Writing in theThe New York Times  Follman said At Mother Jones  where I work as an editor  we have complied an in depth open source database covering more than three decades of public mass shootings  By our measure  there have been four mass shootings this year  including the one in San Bernardino  and at least 73 such attacks since 1982 How do the numbers get so skewed  They get skewed because gun controllers get their information from websites and studies that count incidents in which four people are shot as a mass shooting  whether those people only suffer minimal injuries or not  This means gang crimes drive by shootings  etc are reclassified as mass shootings  Other gang related shootings become mass shootings as well  All the while  the FBIs standard definition for a mass shooting is four fatalities in one incident So Steve Nashs claims are very similar to the claim of 355 mass shootings each year  and have already been debunked Yet he does make some claims that are closer to accurate  but he does not extrapolate the lessons these claims teach about the failure of gun control For example  Nash usesa Players Tribune column to claim 15 of the 20 worst mass shootings in U S  historyhave occurred since 1999  The larger lesson is that many of these shootings occurred in schools  even though the USA adopted a ban on guns in schools on school grounds in during the George H W  Bush administration  The Gun Free School Zone Act is a dismal failure which has only resulted in teachers and staff being unable to defend themselves when an attack occurs Nash throws out a smattering of gun control proposals  including universal background checks  In so doing he overlooks the fact that the Parkland Florida gunman passed a background check for his gun  as does nearly every high profile attacker In the end  gun control is not keeping us safe and more gun control will not change that  Pushing gun control may make us feel good  but good feelings do not allow teachers to defend themselves against armed attackers AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

The Democrats wanted a full repeal of the Dickey Amendment  and Republicans demurred but met them halfway by agreeing to make it clear that the CDC is not barred from doing the research The Dickey Amendment  named after the late Rep  Jay Dickey  R AR  was put into a funding bill in 1996 and has been renewed every year since  It says  None of the funds made available in this title may be used  in whole or in part  to advocate or promote gun control According to The Hill  Democrats claim the amendment put a chilling effect on gun violence research  Republicans responded by suggesting that the only censorship faced by the CDC was self censorship President Obama asked the Republican controlled Congress to fund gun violence research fiscal years 2014 through 2017  but Congress refused Now  however  the Republicans are prepared to clarify that the CDC is not barred from doing gun violence research  even with the Dickey Amendment in place AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
The president held a televised meeting Wednesday with members of both parties and encouraged them to pass more restrictive laws  including a new minimum age of 21 years old for buying a rifle  Trump tweeted Thursday morning  Respect 2nd Amendment Many ideas  some good   some not so good  emerged from our bipartisan meeting on school safety yesterday at the White House  Background Checks a big part of conversation  Gun free zones are proven targets of killers  After many years  a Bill should emerge  Respect 2nd Amendment  Donald J  Trump  realDonaldTrump  March 1  2018 The president has been hit by criticism from conservatives  who are upset that he seemed so eager to shut down House Majority Whip Steve Scalises suggestion of passing concealed carry permit reciprocity  on the one hand  and so enthusiastic about adding Democrats gun control proposals to existing bipartisan proposals  on the other But what was most lacking in Wednesdays meeting was any real defense of the Second Amendment Sen  Pat Toomey  R PA  came closest  when he pushed back against Trumps rebuke for not raising the minimum age in his bill with Sen  Joe Manchin  D WV  to expand background checks After Trump accused Toomey and Manchin of being afraid of the NRA  Toomey explained  My reservation about it  frankly  is that the vast majority of 18 19  and 20 year olds in Pensylvania who have a rifle or a shotgun  theyre not a threat to anyone  Theyre law abiding citizens  They have that because they want to use it for hunting or target shooting  And to deny them their Second Amendment right is not going to make anyone safer But neither Toomey nor anyone else explained the substance of that right In a free wheeling debate  where the president seemed open to listening to all points of view  Democrats were not shy about promoting their view that gun ownership was the fundamental problem for school safety  while the Republicans present failed to make the case for the Second Amendment as the foundation of liberty The whole discussion took place in problem solving mode  where it was taken for granted that the government had to do something in response to the shooting in Parkland  Florida  even though  arguably  it was the governments failure to do something that allowed the shooting to take place  or that allowed it to continue as long as it did once it had begun No one  not even Republicans  made the case that until law enforcement can do its job  we should not infringe on one of the most fundamental freedoms of all Joel B  Pollak is Senior Editor at Large at Breitbart News  He was named to Forwards 50 most influential Jews in 2017  He is the co author ofHow Trump Won  The Inside Story of a Revolution  is available from Regnery  Follow him on Twitter at  joelpollak ,0

The Daily Caller reported that searches for the term NRA membership surged to peak popularity on Google during the student gun control event  And the Daily Wire noted that  when the last 14 years of search data for the term NRA membership was examined  it showed searches for the phrase spiked higher over the weekend than  in response to the gun control push and campaign against the NRA after Sandy Hook Google searches for the term NRA membership rose significantly  but briefly  following the heinous attack on Sandy Hook and the subsequent gun control push  However  that surge was well beneath the one that followed Democrats immediate attempts to use the Parkland school shooting for gun control Ironically  there was no surge of searches for NRA membership following the April16  2007  Virginia Tech shooting  Thirty two innocents were killed in that horrific crime  but the Daily Wire opines that it did not lend itself to a gun control campaign because the attacker used handguns instead of an AR 15  AK 47  or similar rifle While handguns are far more prevalent for criminal use than AR 15s  AK 47s  or any other rifle  it should be noted that even knives are used in more homicides than assault weapons FBI crime stats say that over four times as many people were stabbed to death in 2016 than were killed with rifles of any kind AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

On December 22  2017  Breitbart News reported that the ATF was taking comment on their intention to change the definition of machinegun so as to include a firearm that is not a machinegun as well  This would allow them to use the National Firearms Act  1934  to regulate machineguns and non machineguns in the same way  which would allow them to treat simple firearm accessories and actual firearm conversion devices the same Currently  bump stocks are not regulated because Barack Obamas ATF evaluated them and noted that they do not convert the action of a semiautomatic into that of an automatic  Even with a bump stock  a semiautomatic rifle only fires one round per each pull of the trigger  The ATF seeks to circumvent this fact by changing the definition of words  thereby allowing itself to regulate conversion devices and non conversion devices alike The ATF took public comment on this backdoor bump stock gun control through January 25  2018  and The Trace a gun control journalism outlet reports that 85 percent of respondents opposed the proposed controls The Trace examined 32 000 of the comments and found that only 13 percent favored the regulatory gun control  They noted that Gun Owners of America was the predominant gun rights organization fighting against the backdoor gun control  while Gabby Giffordss gun control group was central in the unsuccessful effort to stir up support for a bump stock ban On January 11  2018  Breitbart News reported Gun Owners of Americas warnings that an ATF ban on bump stocks prove insidious  expanding as needed to cover over gun controls desired by the ruling class  Former ATF gun tech chief Rick Vasquez echoed GOAs warnings  explaining that terms that are redefined for the purposes of a bump stock ban can easily be applied to cover bans on other firearm accessories AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

The signs that the self described socially conscious protesters held up high during the march  along with countless other items of trash  were littered on the streets of D C  like old rags Cardboard signs bearing messages such as My dress code is stricter than your gun laws  and signs demanding that no money be sent to the pro gun National Rifle Association were tossed aside like yesterdays news The crowd not only tossed aside their messages  they also left scraps of food on the ground Many protesters have a history of leaving behind their trash without thinking about the environment around them At the 2017 Womens March on Washington  the pussy hat wearing protesters along the march route refused to pick up after themselves  leaving a trail of coffee cups along the march route The trend of protesters discarding their trash along protest routes is not limited to D C  In 2014  400 000 environmentally conscious people marching for climate change in New York City littered the streets with their trash ,0

After listening to Sen Chris Murphy  D CT  Trump looked at toward the end of the table and asked Sens  Pat Toomey  R PA  and Joe Manchin  D WV  to detail their gun control bill The Manchin Toomey gun control bill is the same universal background check legislation supported by Barack Obama in the wake of the heinous attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School  It the very bill that was defeated in the Democrat controlled Senate on April 17  2013 Toomey described it for Trump  saying the bill strengthens the reporting of information into the background check system and requires background checks on all commercial sales  This is code talk for requiring background checks on private gun sales  which Toomey described as sales at gun shows and online  even though online sales already require a background check Manchin then spoke and suggested that West Virginians will support the Manchin Toomey gun control bill if Trump will support it  He did not mention that the Manchin Toomey bill would not have prevented the Florida attack  just as it would not have prevented the Sandy Hook attack that spawned it Trump spoke of the using the Manchin Toomey bill as a base to which other gun bills can be added  and then continued taking comments from various senators and representatives in attendance When it was Rep  Scalises time to speak  he highlighted the crime fighting value of concealed carriers and the need to pass national reciprocity legislation  National reciprocity was introduced in the House on January 3  2017  and passed in the House on December 6  2017  It was introduced in the Senate on March 1  2017  and it has yet to come up for a vote nor has Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said a word in support of it Trump shut down Scalises reciprocity push  suggesting the gun control package being pieced together would never pass if national reciprocity were added to it Trump looked at Scalise and said  You know Im your biggest fan in the whole world  I think that maybe that bill will someday pass  but it should pass as a separate bill   Youll never get this passed  If you add concealed carry to this  youll never get it passed  Let it be a separate bill Trump added  We want to get something done AWR Hawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for the Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

Malkins comments were directed towards students of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland  Florida  advocating for further federal restrictions on the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms Elevating teenagers as thought leaders impedes the pursuit of effective preventative measures against mass shootings  said Malkin We could not have this discussion of actual  practical school security plans when these children  who are being used and exploited as human props for the likes of Moms Demand Action  were screaming at the likes of Donald Trump when they should be screaming at their school administrators  the Broward County sheriff  and these school resources officers who treated their job like they were Mayberry police  said Malkin Hostility from left wing students should be directed towards local enforcement  said Malkin  pointing to the failures of the Broward Countys Sheriffs Office  including the refusal of local deputies to engage Nikolas Cruz as he carried out a mass murder The fish apparently rotted from the head down at the sheriffs office  said Malkin  describing Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel  a left wing Democrat and leadership council member of Hillary Clintons 2016 president campaign in Florida  as feckless and waging a CYA campaign Malkin predicted that multimillion dollar lawsuits  will be filed  against the people who are truly responsible for the massacre  pointing to school administrators and the sheriffs office of Broward County Mansour noted Israels refusal to accept responsibility  during CNNs town hall on gun policy for his offices failure to address forwarnings of the Florida school mass murderers violent proclivities  including local police being called to his familys home 39 times since 2010   The sheriff just point blank denied it  pretended like this didnt happen  said Mansour  This guy is basically just blaming the NRA and anybody who wants to hold true to the Second Amendment when his entire force just completely dropped the ball School administrators and local authorities abdicated their duties in ignoring warning signs of Cruzs behavior  said Malkin  It is mind boggling that there wasnt a single adult that wanted to take responsibility They do not have wisdom  said Malkin of children  drawing on her latest op ed entitled  Do Not Let the Children Lead and reflecting on her own experience as a mother of two teenage children  Being able to parrot anti NRA talking points is not wisdom CNNs gun control town hall featured obnoxious teenagers  said Malkin  pointing to Emma Gonzalez  whom she called the Shannon Watts Jr  of the lefts push for gun control Social justice teachers  these agitators  Malkin added  cultivate this behavior in their students A lot of people have remarked about how obnoxious some of the teenagers were that were elevated by CNN at the town hall  and I made the point that they dont just get like that  There are parents  there are teachers  there are adults in their lives that countenance their behavior  and I thought it was very noteworthy that Emma Gonzalez  who has become the Shannon Watts Jr   when she was about to question  NRA spokeswoman Dana  Loesch  instead turned to her teacher  and thanked her teacher for making her what she was  I think that was a real revelation  because that tells you that its these social justice teachers  these agitators  who have been egging these students on As she described the failures and lack of responsibility of the Florida educators in preventing last weeks mass shooting  Malkin reflected on her own mothers experiences as a public school teacher for three decades There wasnt a single adult that wanted to take responsibility  And I say this would a caveat because  of course  schools have been forced to turn into these all purpose social welfare centers  and it does seem quite unfair to expect schools to do all of this  However  thats what local communities are for   My mom was a public school teacher in South Jersey in a troubled school district  a minority majority school district  that had been taken over by the state  and she was there for almost three decades  and she had to put up with one of the worst teachers unions in the country  the mafia of the NJEA  and it wore on her  But year after year  she would do all the extra curricular activities  she would take kids into our home  she would drive them from South Jersey to Philadelphia so they could be exposed to musical theater and the arts  Its just something she did because she felt it was part of being a good teacher  She took responsibility   I was talking with her earlier today  and she said  Why arent there more parents demanding to know where the school administrator was  Where the guidance counselor was  Where were all the people who knew when Nikolas Cruz was walking onto campus  they knew it was him  they knew he was trouble  Nobody has been forced to answer for it  because again  the big bogey man is the NRA and its so much easier to demonize five million law abiding gun owners than to point fingers at people in your own backyard Your mom sounds like the type of educator everybody wants their kids to have  the type that takes responsibility  said Mansour to Malkin Malkin speculated that he Baker Act  a Florida state law allowing for involuntary institutionalization and medical examination of a person  could have been used to institutionalize and examine Cruz prior to his commission of mass murder  Such an institutionalized would have been on a firearm purchase background check  preventing Cruz for legally purchasing firearms Clearly there were all these red flags  said Malkin  I dont understand why the Baker Act was not triggered  You look at the actual criteria  a clear and present danger and imminent threat to oneself or others  and you look at the reams of laws at the local  state  and federal level Henderson Behavioral Health  a mental health facility in Florida  examined Cruz in 2016 and opted against hospitalizing him  I believe that would have counted as the kind of adjudication that Nikolas Cruz wouldve had to report on his background check  said Malkin Cruzs 17 year old brother Zachary was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric facility  via the Baker Act  two days after the mass shooting last week  noted Mansour Malkin also suggested thatracial and ethnic quotas regardingschool discipline could be related to last weeks mass murder in Florida The link between the social justice school administrators who adopted those radical left wing policies subsidized by federal tax dollars that have the aim and goal of eradicating any kind of disproportionate reporting actions on these campuses because too many Latino and black students were being reported  So what did they do instead  Report no one  Its not a big leap to think that that attitude seeped into the Broward County deputies that were assigned to patrol the school and school resource office  as well  It just goes to show that political correctness always has bloody consequences  We knew that when it came to jihad  How many other school districts have adopted these same conflict resolution policies that result in looking the other way at clear menaces Political correctness is deadly  said Mansour  I think that we wrap political correctness around ourselves like a suicide belt  Were going to kill ourselves over our stupidity with these things Breitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXMs Patriot channel 125

That criticism is silly  Zucker told The Hollywood Reporter on Monday when asked about American Conservative Union Chair Matt Schlapps remarks about how CNN has decided to take this path where they are kind of left wing advocates The network has been criticized for staging a WWE like town hall event last week in which the network did its best to portray gun control advocates as heroes and defenders of the second amendment as villains Moderator Jake Tapper protected Sen  Bill Nelson  D FL  from having to answer a tough question about the National Rifle Association  NRA  while questioners smeared Republicans who took campaign donations from the NRA as child murderers who accepted blood money  The crowd also jeered a rape survivor who is a strong supporter of the second amendment while CNN let Broward Sheriff Scott Israel grandstand without taking any responsibility for how local authorities and institutions failed the victims Zucker  though  argued that the network did not favor one side over the other  He also said it was not CNNs problem that Florida Governor Rick Scott and President Donald Trump did not show up to an event that they knew would be used to embarrass and shame them The fact is we were there  we presented both sides  People who want to criticize are looking to just criticize before they even think about it  Zucker continued  He added that last weeks town hall was a really important milestone in this conversation because for one of the few times  people who have different points of view were together And the problem is  all too often  whether its on blogs or websites or partisan television networks  people are just talking to themselves  the CNN chief added  And nothing will ever change if we dont start talking to one another The networks anchors have routinely allowed gun control advocates to push their agenda after the Florida tragedy with hardly any constructive pushback while defenders of the second amendment have been met with significance resistance CNN  which has enthusiastically promoted more gun control while falsely claiming to be objective instead of admitting its left wing point of view like MSNBC  has also been criticized for using Parkland survivors as props to push gun control immediately after the attack  On Sunday  CNN even brought on Dan Rather on Reliable Sources to say he was in awe of the Parkland students organizing marches for gun control  Rather actually compared the students activism to the 1960s civil rights marchers After conceding that NRA supporters may boycott companies that severed ties with the organization after pressure from social justice Internet mobs  CNN also enthusiastically told its audience on Monday that companies are now taking a stand on gun control in addition to climate change  immigration  and gay rights  The network claimed thats actually good for business  citing a recent poll that found the most important thing to consumers is to buy from companies that do the right thing The Hollywood Reporter even suggested that the Hollywood activism that CNNs town hall and coverage sparked may not be helping the networks image at all Perhaps not helping CNNs image  the town hall also sparked renewed activism among liberals pushing for gun control  especially in Hollywood  Parks and Recreation creator Michael Schur and showrunner Shonda Rhimes joined the chorus of anti NRA sentiment on Twitter  and NBCs Blacklist star Megan Boone declared that her character no longer will carry assault weapons ,0

This mornings key headlines from GenerationalDynamics com High school students and their families in Washington on Saturday for the March for our Lives  ZeroHedge Saturdays March for our Lives rallies were national and international  The current generation of high school students held a spectacular coming out party on Saturday  as millionsof students and their families flooded into Washington and cities around the world  For many of the kids  this must have been the most exciting and thrilling day of their young lives So the first thing to understand is that these kids are not Millennials  People born since 1999 are in a new generation  the next generation after Millennials  called the Pivotal Generation  because they are pivoting away from the Millennials  or often called Generation Z  a name they hate The recent school shooting in Florida has triggered a rather spectacular entrance by the Pivotals into national politics  and they are driving politics in several new directions that differ from the Millennials Democrats completely co opted Saturdays March for our Lives rallies by excluding any high school student from speaking who took any position contrary to the positions of the Democratic party leadership  Thus all the political messages were pro gun control  anti Republican  anti National Rifle Association  NRA  and opposed to any solutions proposed by other parties  such as gun violence restraining orders  arming school resource officers  and updating instant criminal background checks However  the kids in the Pivotal Generation do not by any means hold positions matching those in the Democratic Party  As for getting gun control enacted  they are tilting at windmills  Within a few months  the Pivotals will be on to a new and even more exciting issue  and this issue will be forgotten  NBC News and March for Our Lives web site and Zero Hedge The attitudes of the Pivotals are not anti NRA at their core  The Pivotals are pro security  especially school security  The rallies were called March for our Lives  not March to kill the NRA  Since there is really no solution to the school security problem  they allowed their rally to be co opted by the anti NRA stance because it is the only thing they understand  However  the pro security policy is much more right wing than left wing Research on the Pivotals during the last year or two has revealed three major themes in their political beliefs In generational theory  a regeneracy event is an event that regenerates civic unity and unifies the country behind the countrys leader for the first time since the end of the preceding generational crisis war  WW II in this case  A regeneracy event today might be  for example  a North Korean nuclear weapon ballistic missile attack on Los Angeles  With their demand for total security and willingness to work for success  the Pivotals in case of war would combine into a powerful patriotic force willing to do whatever is necessary to fight for the nation  They will truly be the next Greatest Generation Whatever events unfold in the future  the Pivotal Generation is pivoting away from Millennials and other generations and is adopting a unique set of attitudes and behaviors that will end up being a surprise to everyone  including both political parties  Barkley US and Barkley US  PDF  and Reno Gazette and Inc According to the U S  government Census Bureau The term baby boomer refers to individuals born in the United States between mid 1946 and mid 1964  Hogan  Perez  and Bell  2008  Distinctions between the baby boom cohort and birth cohorts from preceding and subsequent years become apparent when fertility measures are framed within a historical context  The baby boom in the United States was marked by a substantial rise in birth rates post World War II  Two features of the baby boom differentiate this increase from those previously experienced  the size of the birth cohort and the length of time for which these higher levels of fertility were sustained In other words  many couples held off having children during the Great Depression and World War II  but as soon as the war ended they started having children as quickly as possible The birth year range 1946 1964 for Boomers makes sense for demographic purposes  which is the business that the Census Bureau is in  But from the point of view of Generational Dynamics  it is not particularly useful  The useful question is NOT When is the first year that babies were born after World War II  The useful question is  When is the first year that babies were born when they were never personally aware of and traumatized by the horrific events of World War II Generally speaking  you have to be about four years old to be aware of what is going on in the world  and so for generational theory  the earliest birth year for the Boomers is not 1946  but is 1942  Anyone born earlier  the Silent Generation  would likely have been traumatized by World War II  and anyone born later would likely not have even been aware of World War II  That is why I do not use the phrase born after WW II to describe the Boomers  Instead  I use the phrase growing up after WW II The Silent Generation is the one preceding the Boomers  They got that name in an interesting way  They were originally called the Depression Babies  obviously because they were born just before or during the Great Depression of the 1930s  However  during the 1950s  Time Magazine began calling them the Silent Generation  and the name stuck The reason that Time called them the Silent Generation is because they never complained about anything  They had grown up during the Depression  they had seen their fathers  brothers and uncles die gruesomely during the war  and by the 1950s they were happy to have families  jobs  and a home with a white picket fence  They did their jobsand worked patriotically to help rebuild the world after World War II The period after a crisis war like World War II is called a Recovery Era  since it is everybodys job to help the nation and the world recover from the war The Census Bureau says that the last birth year for Boomers was 1964  Once again  that is useful for demographers  but for Generational Theory  we identify the end of the Recovery Era and the beginning of the Awakening Era as the beginning of social activism by Boomers  as they come of age  For us  the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom is the beginning of the Awakening Era  as the first major activist event by the Boomers  As in the case of the Boomers  we subtract four yearsand set 1959 as the last birth year for the Boomers and the first birth year for Generation X The children in Generation X grew up in a world that seemed like total chaos to them  There was rioting in the streets  males were burning their draft cards  girls were burning their bras  there was streaking  there was the Summer of Love in 1967  the riots at the Democratic convention in 1968  the killing of students at Kent State University  and a vast generation gap over the Vietnam war and race and environment issues Whereas the Boomers were pampered as children in the Baby Boom following WW II  the Gen Xers were left mostly on their ownand were definitely not pampered  Whereas the Boomers had a stable childhood with families and parents with jobs  the Gen Xers were surrounded by social unrest and instability  In particular  feminist organizations were telling mothers to dump their husbands  and not let the kids see their fathers  in order to get as much money as possible  So many Gen Xers grew up with no fathers  with a chaotic personal life  and a great deal of bitterness towards the Boomer generation  whom they blamed for their misfortunes  Without fathers and with no moral compass  they had a high delinquency rate  and are one of the most jailed generations in American history As I have described many times in the last 15 years  Generation X got their revenge against their fathers by bringing about the financial crisis  In the 1990s  Gen Xers got degrees in Financial Engineering  and used their skills in the 2000s to knowingly create trillions of dollars worth of fraudulent subprime mortgage backed securities  which they could sell to the parents generation to get revenge  The result was that millions of people when bankrupt and lost their homes The Awakening Era began in 1963 and ended in 1983  That was followed by the Unraveling Era  where all the rules and institutions that had been implemented in the 1950s to prevent another Great Depression and another World War were dismantled  This resulted in the tech bubble of the late 1990s and the huge credit bubble of the mid 2000s decade The Unraveling Era was a period of opulent wealth in the hands of many people  mainly because they went deeply into debt and spent the money on cars  vacations  and other items of conspicuous consumption The Unraveling Era began in 1983 and ended in 2003  58 years after the end of World War II  2003 was the beginning of the new Crisis Era  The birth years for the next generation  the Millennial Generation  was thus 1979 to 1999  Millennials grew during this period of opulence provided by astronomical debt  many Millennials developed the attitude that money and success could just be given to them The financial crisis brought this period of opulence to an abrupt end  The Pivotal Generation  which grew up during this period  pivoted away from the Millennials and adopted that attitude that it is necessary to work hard for money and success Incidentally  the name Pivotal Generation is only temporary  Just as the Depression Babies became the Silent Generation  the Pivotal Generation will be given a new name by society at some point in the future  after they have actually accomplished something  rather than just giving press conferences in Washington  US Census Bureau  PDF  and Pew Research Related Articles KEYS  Generational Dynamics

Tuesdayon CBS This Morning  former President Jimmy Carter said the National Rifle Association  NRA  represented the interests of gun manufactures and sellers  not gun owners Talking about student gun control activists  Carter said  I just hope and pray they will be persistent in their commitment and they will continue to use their influence on adults that who have reached voting age already  and when they reach voting age they will be willing to turn out of office the people who have abjectly submitted themselves to the domination of the NRA He added  The NRA basically represents gun manufacturers and sellers instead of the average hunters and people who use guns for their own defense  I think the distortion of the Second Amendment has been a mistake  There is no threat to the Second Amendment among the side of young people to have good background checks before you can buy a weapon and you can do away with the rapid fire military weapons that we have authorized Follow Pam Key on Twitter  pamkeyNEN ,0

The town halls are being assembled by professional progressive activists  with primary participation from Indivisible  a radical organization thatdescribes itself as a progressive grassroots network of local groups seeking to resist the Trump Agenda The town halls are also being organized by a group calling itself the Town Hall Project  which is assisting the organizers of the March for Our Lives movement to stage the town hall forums nationwide The Town Hall Project is led by professional organizers  It gained notoriety when it organized activists last year to support progressive healthcare legislation Hogg and the March for Our Lives organizers are seeking to channel the energy of anti gun protesters into town halls for every member of Congress during the current recess that ends April

politicians accountable for accepting money from the National Rifle Association and the gun lobby  though he encouraged all constituents to attend  not just advocates of gun control  but those who have opinions about school safety or mental health policy The Town Hall Project  Hogg and Indivisible each have issued calls for the nationwide forums with lawmakers during the current recess  with

partby Soros  When it was first founded in 2003  Sorospledged up to  3 million for the group  The billionaire has since provided numerous annual grants to CAP  including a  400 000 grant in 2013 for the CAPs campus activism wing  a  350 000 grant in 2012 to their legal action arm and numerous other grants  CAP has also received near annual grants from the Soros funded Tides Foundation The Town Hall Project says it is supported by hundreds of grassroots donors and lists only one partner by name  the NextGen America organization On the main page of its official website  NextGen America calls for resistance in the progressive battle for environmental activism as well as the fight for immigrant rights  affordable health care and core American values NextGen America was founded by Democratic mega donor Tom Steyer Town Hall Project Managing Director Nathan Williams has described his groups mission thusly  Its safe to say most of our team are motivated by a desire to fight the Trump agenda Williams told McClatchy last week that the aim is to hold 535 town halls over Congressional recess  This is not an unreasonable thing to expect  If they can meet with donors every recess they can take an hour to talk to constituents  it is called district work period  said Williams  But yes  its safe to say that not all 535 will host town halls over recess  There will probably be mostly empty chair town halls on the seventh McClatchy further reported Williams said theyve gotten calls from more than 300 potential organizers from about 130 districts on hosting town halls on April 7  If the member of Congress refuses to show up  theyll have an empty chair town hall  inviting members campaign opponents and hosting constituents to voice their concerns  So far  48 members of Congress have in person town halls scheduled over the recess  and about a third of them are Republicans More than a dozen such empty chair town halls were officially organized by Thursday  including ones for Reps  Devin Nunes  R Calif  Ken Buck  R Colo  Ron Estes  R Kan  Erik Paulsen  R Minn  and Sen  Rob Portman  R Ohio But March for Our Lives organizers  coming off a weekend that saw hundreds of thousands of people participate in rallies for gun control reform across the nation  arent giving up  Williams said Town Hall Project reached out a week before the march to offer its help and floated the idea that this march happening before a recess was a great time to demand town halls  The Parkland students have been pushing people over social media to organize town halls since Sunday Last year  following a violent scuffle at an event with Rohrabacher  Republican lawmakers expressed concern for their safety at town hall events  The concern came amid calls for stepped up activism at town halls from a coalition of professional activist groups  especially the Town Hall Project  the Soros funded MoveOn org  and Democracy for America  The storm the town halls strategy reportedly resulted in Republican town halls being swamped by activists The disruptions prompted Rep  Louie Gohmert  R TX  and other Republican lawmakers last year to opt for the safety of telephone conference calls instead of in person town halls  with Gohmert explaining he would hold the phone sessions until the threat of violence at town hall meetings recedes Unfortunately  at this time there are groups from the more violent strains of the leftist ideology  some even being paid  who are preying on public town halls to wreak havoc and threaten public safety  Gohmert wrote in a letter to his constituents at the time Rohrabacher criticized the Indivisible protesters who stormed his event last year as part of a nationwide  anti Trump mobilization that is engaged in political thuggery  pure and simple While Hogg openly pushes the town halls along with a coalition of left wing groups  he appeared on MSNBC on Tuesday to deny that any shadowy figures are behind his gun control activism He was replying to a charge from Bill OReilly linking Hoggs efforts to get advertisers to boycott Laura Ingrahams television show to the Media Matters activist group Im pretty well lit  I dont see any shadowy figures behind me  Hogg stated  I mean  honestly  if he sees shadowy figures as corporate America standing by us  OK  I guess  It doesnt really make sense OReilly made the charge following an article by this reporter documenting that the Soros funded Media Matters has been helping to fuel Hoggs advertising boycott targeting Laura Ingrahams Fox News show The Ingraham Angle host last week tweeted a Daily

And the Parkland  Florida teens are promoting the second National School Walkout taking place across the country on Friday  But the anti gun  anti Trump walkout is the brainchild of Lane Murdock  a high school sophomore in Connecticut It is not conservative or liberal  Murdock  16  said in an interview with National Public Radio  NPR  It is just about making sure our children dont get harmed in school and we dont live in a community and in a country that has institutionalized fear I think were all sick of it  Murdock said  Thats why were doing this We have grown up waiting for change  Now this generation will work for it and demand it   A role we should have never had to take   NationalSchoolWalkout  Lane Murdock  lanemurdock2002  April 16  2018 On the day of the Florida school attack by a former student with a long history of mental health issues and run ins with law enforcement  Murdock posted a petition on change org asking people to join her and students at her school on March 14 for a 17 minute school walkout to honor the 17 victims  It has over 250 000 signatures But just like the March 24 March for Our Lives event planned by the Parkland teens  the walkout to remember lost friends has been taken over by liberal  adult led  anti gun  anti Trump groups like Indivisible  linked to on the National School Walkout website and cited in NPRs report These student organizers have gotten help from a national nonprofit called Indivisible  a group that says it aims to fuel young people to resist the Trump agenda  NPR reported And Murdocks views have evolved since she started the petition She wants people to know that shes imagining this day to be very different than the March For Our Lives or the 17 minutes of silence on March 14 in honor of the victims in Parkland  Fla  NPR reported  This walkout will last from 10 a m  through the end of the day People ask me  like  Why  Why all day ' Murdock says Thats because this is a topic that deserves more than 17 minutes ' NPR reported The now day long walkout will include more political activities  including a call to action to register voters and writing to elected representatives pressing for gun control We are getting ready  are you  And of course I am always rocking the house shoes   NationalSchoolWalkout pic twitter com GoJDTYvdVm  Lane Murdock  lanemurdock2002  April 16  2018 The latest walkout was planned for the April 20  1999 anniversary of the shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado where 15 people died  including the two students who perpetrated the attack But as Breitbart News reported  Jason E  Glass  superintendent of Jeffco public schools  asked students in his school district to make the anniversary about honoring victims instead of a day of protest Given our own shared experiences  the events in Parkland  Florida certainly struck close to our heart  We are quickly approaching April 20  the 19th anniversary of the Columbine tragedy  Though we offer our heartfelt support to Florida  on this date  most of us thoughtfully reflect on our own history  In Jeffco  we have marked this time of year with positive acts  Columbine High School students participate in a day of service  doing volunteer work for a variety of community organizations and the entire district supports Day Without Hate  with events that promote inclusion and acceptance While the folks in Florida encouraged a demonstration of unified  national support through student walkouts  I request our schools and students consider honoring the memory of Columbine by following the lead of the Columbine community  which believes firmly in the motto  A Time to Remember  a Time to Hope  Coming together  giving back  and having a collective positive impact on our community has been a Jeffco tradition  and I hope we continue that tradition  My hope is if our students and staff feel the need to recognize the anniversary of the Columbine tragedy during the school day  it will be with acts of kindness and service in honor of the memory of those we have lost https twitter com lanemurdock2002 status 984455582135578624 According to the walkout website  some 2 500 walkouts across the country have registered The mission on the walkout website states The National School Walkout is the launch of a forward looking youth movement that has a strategy  a plan for action  and isnt going away We have a three part goal Hold elected officials accountable Promote solutions to gun violence Demystify and engage students in the political system The walkout is scheduled for 10 a m  Friday local time at each school taking part Follow Penny Starr on Twitter ,0
Ironically  assault weapons bans and confiscation orders have been put forward as controls needed in the aftermath of the February 14 Parkland school shooting  Gun control proponents also pushed universal background checks and waiting periods following the Parkland attack  but California has both of those too In fact  California has some of the most stringent gun controls in the country  The assault weapons ban  confiscation orders  universal background checks  and 10 day waiting period are complimented by a requirement that would be firearm owners acquire a safety certificate from the state  that all firearms be registered with the state  and that law abiding citizens pursuing a concealed carry permit demonstrate good cause for wanting to carry a gun Ammunition controls already exist in California  too  These require that Californians only buy ammunition from state approved vendors and  starting January 1  2019  will require residents to pass a point of sale background check for a box of bullets But none of these controls preventedNasim Aghdam from possessing a handgun with which she injured three then killed herself at YouTube headquarters Yet gun control proponents like actor and comedian Michael Ian Black still reacted to the incident by complaining about the easy access to firearms AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

On Thursday night  Fox Newss Laura Ingraham spoke with Andrew Klein  the father of one of students who survived last weeks school shooting massacre in Parkland  Florida Ingraham pointed out  accurately  that CNNs widely criticized Wednesday night townhall event was one sided  The questioners were all anti gun  all opposed the NRA  and launched venomous personal attacks against Sen  Marco Rubio  R FL  and NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch Jake Tapper  the anti Trump anti gun pundit who moderated the spectacle  also had an audience of thousands who all appeared to be rabidly anti gun  going so far as to boo a rape victim as Tapper remained silent  Tapper has yet to disavow his audiences behavior or to apologize to the rape survivor Klein informed Ingraham that his experience with the anti gun cable channel was similar to that of Colton Haab  the shooting survivor and JROTC member being hailed as a hero for leading his fellow students to safety during the massacre Haab has credibly claimed that he dropped out of the townhall event after CNN demanded he read one of their scripted questions  Haab wanted to ask about school security  On three separate occasions now  CNN has publicly called Haab a liar Klein said of CNNs one sided townhall  Laura  thats not surprising at all  I actually spoke to a CNN producer on Thursday  the day after the shooting  he said  adding  and the producer insinuated to me they were looking for people who were willing to espouse a certain narrative  which was taking the tragedy and turning it into a policy debate  and I read that as being a gun control debate When by Ingraham specifically what the CNN producer said  Klein reported  The producer said we are looking for people who want to talk about the policy implications about what happened in terms of  she didnt mention guns  the policy implications for preventing mass shootings Kleins and Haabs allegations are seen by many as credible due to CNNs previous scandals  On numerous occasions the last place network has been caught using left wing plants  The far left CNN is also facing a credibility crisis due tomultiplefakenewsreports only some of which have been retracted or corrected Follow John Nolte on Twitter  NolteNC  Follow his Facebook Page here ,0

The National School Walkout on Wednesday was organized by left wing groups  including the Womens March and Planned Parenthood  and was meant to honor the 17 people who died last month after a former student with mental health issues went on a shooting spree at a Florida high school In many places  including Washington  DC  the walkout turned into protests where young students threatened lawmakers and demanded the gun control agenda of those left wing groups who organized them But now the resolution LaRock introduced in January seems like an idea that is desperately needed to protect American school children from being indoctrinated instead of educated LaRock explained in an interview on Breitbart News Saturday with Washington Deputy Political Editor Amanda House on SiriusXM Patriot 125 that his resolution asks the Board of Education to come up with a code of ethics for teachers in grades K 12 Like the federal Hatch Act  LaRocks resolution  inspired by conservative pundit David Horowitz  would prevent individuals from using their position to promote their political views or support a specific candidate Thats exactly what is happening in schools  LaRock said  I think many teachers are using their position as a role model and an educator Teachers are imposing their own personal views  very often their pretty extremely liberal views  on kids through lessons and comments and sometimes even bullying kids that dont agree with their liberal viewpoint  LaRock said Its just very  very inappropriate and wrong  LaRock said  citing an example of a local school teacher who signed up to be a coordinator for the walkout on a website using her school e mail address And while the desire to keep kids safe in school is not a partisan issue  using children as political tools is not the way to achieve that goal  LaRock said We all share the goal of making schools safer  LaRock said But to have these kids  put them out in the spotlight  I think in many cases ill informed  and using them as political tools is right out of the Alinsky school of political activism  LaRock said  referring to Saul Alinsky  the so called founder of community organizing So this K 12 Code of Ethics for teachers simply proposes setting some boundaries  reasonable boundaries  that respects teachers right to free speech maybe in their off time  but also recognizes that when they have kids there in the classroom thats not a time for the teacher to be promoting their own personal viewpoints or policies or candidates  La Rock said LaRock said parents were caught off guard by the walkout  but now many are angry about it There are a lot of people that are pretty furious about this  LaRock said  I think it took a while to sink in because we do think of schools as places where kids go to be taught in reading  writing  and arithmetic and a bunch of other good things but not to be trained into being little activists  LaRock said LaRock said students should be taught to be critical thinker  not recipients of political rhetoric He said parents need to get involved in their childrens education Parents need to be driving the discussion  whether its with the schools themselves or with their own kids so that were not just this angry mob reacting on emotion  LaRock said Follow Penny Starr on Twitter ,0

Hogg made this observation on MSBNCs Morning Joe Joe Scarborough looked at Hogg and asked  Are you starting a rising concern about how the Broward Sheriffs operated  staying outside while the shooting was going on Hogg responded  Im glad you bring that up  It is definitely a raising concern  the fact that they didnt go in  He then suggested that the deputys lack of action raises questions about trusting teachers to provide defense for their students  How can you expect teachers to step in and take action if trained security guards that are part of the sheriffs department wouldnt take action Hoggs observation overlooks the fact that school security should is not an either or situation but one based on a both and approach  In other words  schools are not in a need of armed security guards or armed teachers but armed security guards and armed teachers  That way  if an armed security guards fails to confront the shooterfor whatever reasonthe students can be protected by the teachers who are already there President Trump addressed this on February 22 by noting first responders are 5 to 8 minutes away when a school shooting occurs but teachers are there to shoot sickos immediately AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
Since the early 1990s  Kleck has maintained that there is a minimum of 760 000 DGUs annually  That is hislow estimate  Kleck and research partner Marc Gertz have contended the actual number is closer to 2 5 million Kleckreaffirmedhis numbers on February 17  2015  explaining that while plenty of naysayers have criticized his findings  none have been able to offer empirical evidence to counter them Now  a CDC study conducted on data from 1996  1997  and 1998 has been uncovered  The study  which was never released to the public  shows approximately 2 46 million DGUs per year Kleck summarized the CDC findings In 1996  1997  and 1998  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  conducted large scale national surveys asking about defensive gun use  DGU  They never released the findings  or even acknowledged they had studied the topic  I obtained the unpublished raw data and computed the prevalence of DGU  CDCs findings indicated that an average of 2 46 million U S  adults used a gun for self defense in each of the years from 1996 through 1998  almost exactly confirming the estimate for 1992 of Kleck and Gertz  1995  Possible reasons for CDCs suppression of these findings are discussed On April 20  2018  Reason magazine quoted Klecks reaction to the unpublished CDC findings  he explained that a figure of 2 46 million DGUs a year  implies that guns were used defensively by victims about 3 6 times as often as they were used offensively by criminals AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
McConaughey spoke about his support for the marchers on Monday in Las Vegas  where he was promoting his upcoming film  White Boy Rick  at the CinemaCon theater owners convention He called gun violence an epidemic in our country Ive got a lot of friends who are gun owners  Ive got a lot of friends who are NRA  National Rifle Association  I grew up hunting  We had responsible gun ownership  but I was taught the right way to respect that tool  he said  At the same time  their petition that they were speaking about is a very good one  And I also fear that their campaign  they have to watch that they dont get hijacked  Meaning  a lot of the crowd was for no guns at all  That was not the march for life  March for Our Lives was for rightful  just  responsible gun ownership  but against assault rifles  against unlimited magazines and for following up on the regulations The 48 year old Oscar winner said he hoped to find room for agreement between anti gun activists and the NRA The two sides  have  got to talk  Because we both agree that theres an epidemic  We both agree something has got to change  So I was for what they were marching for  and I wanted to speak to my hometown on the capital of my state Texas steps  And also talk to the many men and women who I grew up with  I know that had the guns  that owned the guns  and say hey  do we really  where can we reach across the aisle here  Find a compromise for the betterment of all of us McConaughey plays the father of a teenager who becomes a drug dealer and an FBI informant in White Boy Rick  based on a true story  Its set for a September release in theaters ,0
Kelly Guthrie Raley  who was selected as Eustis Middle Schools Teacher of the Year 2017 2018 last month  wrote on Facebook Thursday in a now viral post that as an educator  the lack of compassion and increase in violence she has noticed among students are caused by a lack of parental support Parents  its time to step up  Raley wrote  adding Be the parent that actually gives a crap  Be the annoying mom that pries and knows what your kid is doing  STOP being their friend  They have enough friends at school  Be their parent  Being the cool mom means not a damn thing when either your kid is dead or your kid kills other people because they were allowed to have their space and privacy in YOUR HOME Raleys message went viral  as of Saturday afternoon  her post had been shared more than 573 000 timesafter a 19 year old gunman killed 17 people atMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland  Florida  on Wednesday The sixth grade teacher added that when she began her teaching career 20 years ago  she never had to worry about parents getting angry at her or threatening her publicly because she brought up issues with their childrens behavior She said the trend of parents not wanting to take responsibility for their childrens behavior has to change if violence in the classroom is to be stopped Despite the many cries for gun control in light of the shooting  Raley said her post was not meant to push for gun control  but to encourage parents to love their children and students to show respect for one another This post wasnt about gun control  she said  This was me  loving the crap out of people and wanting the best for them  This was about my school babies and knowing that God created each one for greatness  and just wanting them to reach their futures ,0
On Friday  conservative journalist Jay Cost took to Twitter to remind his followers how Scarborough as the congressman for Floridas first congressional district was onceone of those politicians that opposed more gun control Cost offers citations from two volumes of Michael Barone and Grant Ujifusas The Almanac of American Politics to back up this claim Hi   JoeNBC  Apropos of nothing  are you a

voting record   Yeah that's gotta be it  Jay Cost  JayCostTWS  February 16  2018 Scarborough was even more strident about his opposition to any gun control measures before being elected to Congress In NRA questionnaires obtained by The Daily Caller in 2013 dated Aug  23  1994 Sept  2  1994 and June 7  2000  Scarborough declared this opposition The NRAmustelect   support candidates who will view the gun rights issue as a constitutional battle  Scarborough wrote on a 1994 questionnaire  The founding fathers did not give us the 2ndAmendment to protect our rights to shoot ducks  Our constitutional right to bear arms is so we may protect our family in the manner we choose No compromise In 1994  California Democratic Sen  Dianne Feinstein introduced the Federal Assault Weapons Ban  It was signed into law by then President Bill Clinton on Sept  13  1994  and that created the decade long ban on manufacturing military looking firearms Just weeks it was signed  Scarborough told the NRA that his definition of an assault weapon was anything the government would deny the people from protecting themselves against the government and anything the government would fear the people could use to protect their rights Scarborough also revealed he was an opponent of expanding federal background checks  limits on magazine capacity  government licensing requirements to buy and or own a firearm  registration and bans on armor piercing ammunition Scarborough apparently responded to Cost with his own sub tweeted thread and claimed he changed his mind as the facts have changed As I have said publicly for years  while in Congress I was one of the 2nd Amendments strongest proponents  And even though the NRA worked nonstop to defeat me in my first campaign  they supported me after because I was always an unyielding advocate for gun rights  I still am  Joe Scarborough  JoeNBC  February 16  2018 As I said publicly in speeches  and TV and in columns  Newtown made me re examine many of my views  I still support gun rights  carry laws  and Scalias view of the 2nd Amendment  But Newtown changed my thoughts on background checks and assault style weapons  as did Heller  Joe Scarborough  JoeNBC  February 16  2018 For those frothing at the mouth thinking they just broke open Al Capones safe  stop humiliating yourselves publicly  Ive been straightforward about my views on for years  I addressed it head on the Monday after Newtown  Joe Scarborough  JoeNBC  February 16  2018 I was one of the most unyielding advocates for gun rights in Congress  The fact that I still strongly support gun rights but am now pushing back hard against extremists who are damaging the cause as mass shooting become an American epidemic only proves my point more  Joe Scarborough  JoeNBC  February 16  2018

During this debate  we were assured and reassured that gay marriage would not affect us  All we want are our rights  All we want is equality  All we want is to be like you  Its no skin off your nose  Over and over  we were promised this Pop culture also weighed in  TV  movies  documentaries  and various news magazines  promised us that gay marriage would bring everyone together  Carefully manufactured depictions portrayed gay nuptials as a means for families and communities to heal old wounds while a sense of Happily Ever After descended over the land Then came the phony media polls that showed a majority in favor of gay marriage  But  as actual voting proved  those polls were rigged  In referendums all around the country  even California  gay marriage failed This is when the lefts mask came off After voting proved Americans were understandably uneasy about gay marriage  the left and their media allies showed their true selves  The era of discussion and democracy abruptly ended  Suddenly we were the targets of venomous hate campaigns  of boycotts  Even though we held the same view of gay marriage Barack Obama did just a few months earlier  the media sought to turn us into something socially unacceptable  we were ostracized  slapped with a scarlet letter as bigots  homophobes  and Nazis who hid behind our evil Christianity Fast forward to 2018 And here we go again Americans do not want gun control  The medias rigged polls might say different  but gun control was a major issue in 2016 and no doubt helped Hillary Clinton lose the pro hunting states of Wisconsin  Michigan  and Pennsylvania  Even after all the emotional blackmail and hysteria over Sandy Hook  the only politicians who lost their seats to gun control were those in favor of it When voters actually go out and vote  gun control is a loser  But if you take a look at the media landscape today  the same thing is happening that happened after it became apparent gay marriage would not succeed through the democratic process  The media is now manufacturing a reality that says those opposed to gun control are in the minority  false  therefore  anyone opposed to gun control is a socially unacceptable freak who want to see innocent children murdered This propaganda campaign  though  is the least of our concerns  What should worry us are the lies  The media continue to reassure us their gun control laws will not affect us  will not result in confiscation  will only keep guns away from evildoers  But like the gay marriage con  this is a lie After our robed masters on the Supreme Court imposed gay marriage on a populace that wanted no part of it  except in Maine and Maryland  immediately  all around the country  left wing activists  backed by the media and fascist governments  started to persecute Christians  violating our First Amendment rights by making us choose between staying in business and betraying our religious conscience  Although same sex marriage is the sacrimentalization of a sin  the State is still forcing wedding cake artists  floral artists  and the like to participate in sin or face crippling sanctions The issue of gay marriage will also be the sword that eventually brings down the Christian church  which was always the lefts goal The same is true of gun control  If the likes of CNNs Jake Tapper can effectively exploit traumatized children as puppets to reiterate the same tired arguments that have already failed coming from his mouth  just as it is with gay marriage  the goal is to strip us of our civil rights  in this case  the civil right to protect ourselves  a right that is even more urgent given the catastrophic law enforcement failures regarding this latest school shooter The medias current goal is not to convince the public  That will never happen  As with gay marriage  we know when we are being hustled  The medias goal is to artificially increase social pressure to a point where lawmakers and judges feel they must do something  must be on the right side of history  must not accept the scarlet letter   This propaganda campaign worked with gay marriage  The Supreme Court overturned the will of the people and Christians are now being persecuted by their own government That was always the gay marriage endgame  and a helpless populace is gun controls endgame Follow John Nolte on Twitter  NolteNC  Follow his Facebook Page here ,0
As in Florida  the legal age to buy a long gun in Washington state is 18  while the legal age for handgun purchases is 21  Cazes says his store policy will require a minimum age of 21 for handgun and long gun sales going forward According to CNN  Cazes describes his new policy as a proactive step that can be taken in the wake of the February 14 attack on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School  He said  I would like to be proactive rather than reactive because the reactive solutions that we come up with dont work He spoke in favor of gun control legislation  addressing the age at which someone can buy a long gun  Currently the handgun age is 21  And it has an FBI check and a state check  But the long gun age  which includes ARs  is only an FBI check  It doesnt have a state check  and the age issue is also another problem  So I would say lets meet in the middle and say lets get this age thing fixed  And put it into a bill But he did not voice support for gun control that goes beyond raising the age for long gun purchases  In fact  he said  Theres no button we can push magically to get rid of all guns  Some people think thats some option we have  and its not Ironically  Cazes also told CNN that the AR 15 is his go to weapon for self defense  saying  Thats my weapon of choice for defending myself and my family AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

Monday on Fox News Channels Tucker Carlson Tonight  host Tucker Carlson opened his show by scoffing at claims by CNNs David Gergen and others that President Donald Trump was actingin an authoritarian manner Carlson argued it was instead the tendency of the left with its positions on speech  firearms  family  faith and bureaucracy that were signs of authoritarianism  not Trump Let's say you were an authoritarian   wanted to weaken American democracy  How'd you do it  1  ban free speech 2  disarm the country 3  undermine families and churches 4  Empower unelected bureaucrats  Trump isn't doing that  The ruling class is  Tucker  FoxNews  Tucker Carlson  TuckerCarlson  February 20  2018 Partial transcript as follows CARLSON  You may have noticed an accelerating cycle in Washington lately  Heres what it looks like  The permanent class hates Donald Trump  They attack him as racist  criminal  a foreign spy working to destroy America Trump  because he watches more bad television than is healthy  sees these attacks and then responds with hostile tweets attacking his critics  His critics then point out those tweets as evidence that Trump is every bit as bad as they said he was and so on Well  the latest installment of the saga took place over the weekend  CNN political analyst David Gergen warned that Trumps criticism of the media proves hes a would be dictator  Watch BEGIN VIDEO CLIP DAVID GERGEN  CNN POLITICAL ANALYST  Discrediting Mueller  discrediting what may come out through the Justice Department from Mueller  discrediting the press and what were reporting on what Mueller does  this is what splits a country apart and it is the beginnings  in many other countries  its been the beginnings of an authoritarian rule  And thats the larger threat hanging over us now END VIDEO CLIP CARLSON  Thats kind of hilarious  The irony  of course  is that David Gergen spent much of his own career in government  not simply criticizing reporters  but actively lying to them  as is the custom  Was that the behavior of a despot  Pretty funny But pause and consider this seriously for a minute  Authoritarianism  Thats what our ruling class says it fears  They tell us that all the time OK  Lets say you really were an authoritarian and you wanted to weaken American democracy and impose a kind of oligarchy on the country  How would you go about doing that Well  youd probably start by trying to control what people say and think  If citizens dissented from the mandated orthodoxy or dared to consider unauthorized ideas  you target them  youd shame them on social media  youd shout them down in public  youd get them fired from their jobs  youd make sure everybody was afraid to disagree with you After that  you would work to disarm the population  You take their guns away  That way  theyd be entirely dependent on you for their safety  not to mention unable to resist your plans for them Then  just to make sure you had quelled all opposition  youd systematically target any institution that might oppose or put brakes on your power  Youd be especially concerned about churches  the family  and independent businesses  Youd be certain to undermine and crush those using laws and relentless propaganda If despite all of that  election results still didnt go your way  youd use an entrenched unelected bureaucracy to neuter any leader you hadnt handpicked yourself  But youd be shaken by an election like that  Youd resolve never to allow one again And to make sure of that  youd work tirelessly to replace the old and ungrateful population with a new and more obedient one  Thats what you do Sound familiar  We are not talking about Donald Trump  For all of his faults  Trump isnt doing any of that  Our ruling class is  And thats what all these issues are really about The speech codes  the calls for gun control  the relentless attacks on the nuclear family  the demands for unlimited mass immigration  none of that is designed to help you  None of it will make you happier or more prosperous  Thats not the point The point is to make you more dependent on the very people who are yelling at you right now on cable television  They are the authoritarians Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter  jeff poor ,0
Instead of focusing on the kind of security hardening that would end these shootings immediately  the media are instead politicizing the issue  hoping to capitalize on a tragedy by focusing on the bitterly divisive issue of gun control  which is practically a non sequitur within this context because there is no law that would have stopped this shooting  or any of the others Appearing on Fox News Sunday  Pollack summoned equal parts wisdom and common sense to chastise host Chris Wallace  and the media in general  for focusing on the polarizing issue of gun control while ignoring the fact that most of our schools are wide open The school shooting problem  is not going to be fixed because I just heard what you said  what youre focusing on  polarizing this event  the murder of these kids  youre talking about gun control  I just had to listen to you and Governor Scott talk about gun control  Gun control is a big issue  No one in America is going to come together on control  Chris You didnt say one thing about fixing it  The American people can get together on school safety  But when you polarize it  this event and every other media  outlet  we dont care about gun control right now  Thats a big issue in the country and youre not going to get everyone together on it  But we can get everyone together on  securing  our schools  I just listened to you  you didnt ask one question of the Governor about What are we going to do about the security of our children  But you are just talking about gun control  which is about more ratings like every other media  outlet My daughters dead  my kids going to go to school in Kentucky on Monday  and what I want to know is how are those kids safe How about bringing that up in the media   My kids not here because the schools werent safe  You go into a courthouse  the judge is safe  the stenographers not worried someones coming in with a gun because they cant get in with a gun  The American people  we just want our schools safe  We dont want to talk about guns right now Later in the interview  Wallace asked Pollack  Isnt this issue of mental health and trying to make sure that sick people dont have access to guns  isnt that part of the problem His answer was perfect Was that a big issue when we were protecting airports  Im not saying its not an issue  Chris  but when we were protecting our federal buildings  was that a big issue  We have our children in these classrooms  Those other issues can be worked out  But right now our country just wants to come together to make our schools safer for our kids   We gotta have metal detectors  Make our schools like a courthouse  like an airport Pollack is not just correct about the issue of school security  He also sees what the media are doing  which is twofold  First  the medias politicizing a massacre to push an anti gun NRA agenda  Secondly  the medias distracting us with this polarizing debate to keep us from talking about security  the only real solution to the problem Pollack understands that if we continue to focus on guns  the problem is not going to be fixed  Why doesnt the media understand this You get the sense that the media  who screech against guns while safe within their own security hardened facilities  are actively opposed to solving this problem Could it be that the media do not want to allow us to discuss security because it might actually work  because if increased security does put a stop to these school shootings  the media will lose these unspeakable tragedies as anti gun talking points Are the media that wicked Follow John Nolte on Twitter  NolteNC  Follow his Facebook Page here ,0

On Saturdays MSNBC Live  Rep  Francis Rooney  R FL  stated that some freedoms are going to have to be given up to ensure unstable people dont get weapons and that he will agree to act on gun control  but not necessarily for normal people  He also expressed uncertainty as to whether people should be allowed to own AR 15s and argued for making schools harder targets Rooney said Well  we are one of the most open societies in the world  I think that each one of these heinous crimes raises the bar and makes us  compels that we  as a nation  rethink where we are on our open society versus what are we willing to do in restricting freedom to make sure that were safe and secure  Very unstable situation here  when someone like a person of this demonstrated mental illness  at the local level and even to the FBI  could get ahold of an assault weapon  weve got to think about that He added  I think this raises the bar significantly  that a person of this demonstrated debility could get ahold an assault weapon  that so many warning signs at the  at all levels of government would go unanswered  and that he could just walk right into another soft target school  Weve got to harden up these schools  Too many schools have been plagued Later  Rooney answered a question on his support for looser gun laws by stating  I thinkthe question is who gets the gun  not the gun itself  I think we need to have really tough laws on background checks and making sure  and waiting periods  maybe even put chips in the guns  so we know where they are  But something  some freedoms are going to have to be given up to make sure that unstable people dont have access to those weapons  Guns dont kill people  The deranged people kill people  and they use guns or theyuse car bombs or they use different things to do it  He further stated that privacy laws absolutely have to be looked at Anchor Alex Witt also asked Is there a reason that you can think of why any private citizen needs to own an AR 15 assault rifle Rooney answered  To be honest with you  Im not sure  I think people should be able to use them in gun ranges if they want to go rip off a lot of caps  if you will  at a gun range  But  do they need to own them and take them out of the facility  Im not sure  This thing here  when a mentally deranged person can get a hold of an AR 15  weve got to deal with that Witt then asked Do you think you and your fellow Republicans are going to agree to do something about gun control now Rooney responded  Well  I certainly am  not necessarily for normal people  But Idefinitely think we need to tighten up background checks to make sure that people like this  shooter in Parkland  cant get weapons Follow IanHanchett on Twitter IanHanchett ,0
In other words  those who believed Silicon Valley firms and their investors would rally to the cause failed to consider the tech industrys abhorrence for any kind of firearms manufacturing  even if such manufacturing was dubbed smart The Journalsreportnotes that calls for such firearms were widespread among many gun control proponents after Adam Lanzas heinous attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 In theory  a gun with a fingerprint reader or  radio frequency identification  technology might stop murderers like Lanza who usedgunspurchased and stored by his mother  and to a greater degree prevent accidental shootings and suicides  The Journal also suggests that smart gun evangelists hope the recent Parkland  Florida  shooting will give them momentum to get something done However  real world problems cloud these theoretical aspirations One such problem is the fact that smart guns with radio frequency identification can be fired by anyone who has the bracelet  ring  or watch with which the firearm is paired  Thus  for example  Lanza could have taken his mothers watch  thereby activating the gun  then killed her with it  gone to school  and carried out his attack by keeping the watch in close proximity to the firearm An even bigger problem lies in the fact that legal gun owners  who alone would be authorized to use the firearms they own  could simply use their smart guns to carry out attacks  The Parkland school shooter used a gun he bought at retail via a background check  A fingerprint reader or radio frequency identification requirement would have done nothing to stop him And that brings us back to smart guns in general  They are a theoretical approach to gun control that is not ready for prime time  In order to be ready  there will have to be lots of investment and testing  followed by more investment and more testing  And the Journalmakes clear that Silicon Valley  the obvious place for such technology to be perfected  is not interested in becoming involved in firearms AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
The Stoneman Douglas attacker  Nikolas Cruz  used a rifle that he bought via a background check from a gun store  not a gun show Toomey and Sen  Joe Manchin  D WV  began pushing gun control together in 2013  and Toomey made clear he and Manchin are pushing it together now  One of the things that Sen  Manchin and I are trying to address  lets at least require a background check for all commercial sales  Thats what our legislation attempts to do by requiring backgrounds on sales at gun shows or over the internet It should be noted that background checks are already required for internet sales  Moreover  as stated earlier  it must be remembered that Cruz acquired his rifle at a gun store via background check  So even if the Manchin Toomey gun control bill had been in effect it would not have prevented the Florida school shooting Ironically  Manchin admitted his gun control would not have prevented the Sandy Hook Elementary School attack  even as the and Toomey pushed it as a response to the Sandy Hook attack  During the April 14  2013  airing of Face the Nation  Manchin said  I acknowledge  theres no single bill that is a panacea for  gun crime  nothing guarantees that a committed criminal isnt going to find a way to get a gun AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

Obama was speaking at the Global Opinion Leaders Summit in Tokyo on Saturday where he cited the march  which was planned following the shooting deaths of 17 people at a high school in Florida last month at the hands of a former student with a long history of mental illness Obama said those students did not want to be silent victims of the gun violence that is so pervasive in the United States These are young people that are 16  17 years old  Obama said  And today there was a march in Washington with hundreds of thousands of people and these rallies were duplicated all around the world And this was all because of the courage and effort of a handful of 15  and 16 year olds who took the responsibility that so often adults have failed to take in trying to find a solution to this problem  Obama said In his remarks  Obama said young people have lost faith in existing institutions and that they need to find ways to make these institutions more relevant to the times and to connect with young people and you cant do that unless you give young people some ability to participate Obama said the teens who planned the march are an example of that kind of participation I think thats a testimony to what happens when young people are given opportunities and I think all institutions have to think about how do we tap into that creativity and that energy and that drive  Obama said But as Breitbart News reported  the rally first planned by high school students was quickly hijacked by the left and gun control groups  transforming it into a turn out the liberal vote event Breitbart News also reported that very few teens actually attended the D C  event Research byUniversity of Maryland sociologist Dana R  Fisher has revealed that about than 10  of the participants in the main March for Our Lives anti gun protest in Washington  DC  on Saturday were under 18 years old  Breitbart News reported The average age of participants  Fisher said  was just under 49 years old Fisher is studying the demographic makeup of the so called Resistance to President Donald Trump and published a commentary in theWashington Post recently Contrary to whats been reported in many media accounts  the D C  March for Our Lives crowd was not primarily made up of teenagers  Only about 10 percent of the participants were under 18  The average age of the adults in the crowd was just under 49 years old  which is older than participants at the other marches Ive surveyed but similar to the age of the average participant at the Million Moms March in 2000  which was also about gun control At the D C  march  the National Education Association teachers union handed out posters from Amplifier org proclaiming that kids  not guns  should be protected  The anti gun Brady Campaign also passed out literature at the D C  event telling participants to press members of Congress to pass stricter gun ownership laws and to vote out gun rights lawmakers in the midterm elections Some of the groups involved in organizing  promoting  and funding the March for Our Lives include the anti gunGiffords an organization started by former Rep  Gabrielle Giffords  D AZ   Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America  Move On  the Womens March  and Planned Parenthood As Breitbart News reported  Cameron Kasky  17  acknowledged that the anti Trump group Indivisible helped with the march and said that their assistance is necessary because of the role race allegedly plays in school shootings Kasky said in an interview on Friday with National Public Radio You know our story was told because we are an affluent white community and we have to shine the spotlight that was given on us on everybody in the world that has to deal with this on a daily basis  So people like Indivisible  who represent students who are in lower income communities and dont get to speak out the way we do because people dont listen  we have to connect with these students Obama praised young people in general in his remarks in Japan Whats interesting when you meet young people  I find this in every country  they are actually just as idealistic as previous generations  maybe more  Obama said  Theyre very well informed Theyre very sophisticated  Obama said  They know whats happening around the world They have a keen sense of injustice and right and wrong  Obama said Follow Penny Starr on Twitter ,0

On Thursday  Patriots Owner Robert Kraft dispatched the team plane to Florida to fly the families of the 17 victims of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting  and some of the students who were injured and survived the incident  to Washington  DC  for the March For Our Lives  But it turns out that gun control advocates were behind the effort to enlist the Patriots in the effort During a Saturday conversation with Breitbart Sports  Patriots Vice President of Media Relations Stacey James said that Patriots Owner Robert Kraft chose to lend his plane to the Parkland families at the request of former Democrat Representative Gabrielle Giffords  and her husband Mark Kelly In 2011  Giffords  was shot in the head by a deranged man outside of a grocery store in Arizona while she met with constituents  The shooting killed six people and injured 13 others  Since recovering from her injuries  Giffords has become a tireless proponent of gun control  She formed her own group titled Giffords Americans for Responsible Solutions and  in 2016  merged that group with the San Francisco based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence According to James  it was Krafts relationship with the Giffords that caused him to get involved The Giffords reached out  Gabrielle and Mark Kelly  James told Breitbart Sports  Mr  Kraft has a very close friendship with the Giffords  They requested that Mr  Kraft use his plane to fly up the families of the victims The New England Patriots airplane is one of the most instantly recognizable aircraft in the NFLnot just because it is adorned in red  white  and blue  but also because its known as the plane that hauls one of the most successful franchises in NFL history all over the country Mr  Kraft did it because he thought it was the right thing to do  James told Breitbart Sports When asked if the Patriots were taking a political stand by flying the victims of a shooting to a march in support of gun control  James did say the Patriots are not supporting gun control No  We are not politicizing this  James said  The Patriots are not taking a stance on gun control  Mr  Kraft did a favor for a friend  because he thought it was the right thing to do  That is the extent of it  we are not taking sides on this issue ,0

This is Trumps biggest gun control statement to date  and it comes just one day day after he urged that we arm teachers to reduce the gun free status of schools around the nation Trump tweeted I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health  Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks  Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue  I hope  Donald J  Trump  realDonaldTrump  February 22  2018 Comprehensive background checks often mean universal background checks  but it is unclear whether that is Trumps position here  His emphasis on mental health means he may be talking about overhauling our current background check system  rather than expanding it Democrats push for expanding background checks after every high profile shooting  even though high profile shooters almost always acquire their guns via background checks  Florida school gunman Nikolas Cruz acquired his gun via a background check On September 18  2015  while campaigning for president  Trump made clear that he would not support an expansion of background checks  He hedged this pledge on the fact that we have had background checks since 1998 and they have not lived up to the promises of safety and crime prevention issued at the time of enactment In other words  background checks have been a fail  so why expand them Trumps push to raise the minimum of age for long gun purchases from 18 years old to 21 is almost certain to happen  and his support of bump stock gun control shared by Sen  Marco Rubio  R FL  and other members of the GOP  making it likely Bump stocks do not convert semiautomatic rifles into fully automatic rifles and they were not used in the Florida school shooting  In fact  the October 1  2017  Las Vegas attack was the only high profile shooting on record in which bump stocks were used  Yet they are increasingly targeted for a ban as the gun control outcry continues To put it another way  a bump stock ban would have done absolutely nothing to prevent the Florida school attack Texas church attack  November 5  2017 the Alexandria attack  June 14  2017  the Orlando attack  June 12  2016  the San Bernardino attack  December 2  2015 the Umpqua Community College attack  October 1  2015  the Lafayette movie theater attack  July 23  2015  the Chattanooga attack  July 16  2015  the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal attack  Jun 17  2015 the Santa Barbara attack  May 23  2014  the Fort Hood attack  April 2  2014  the D C  Navy Yard attack  September 16  2013  the Aurora movie theater attack  July 20  2012  the Gabby Giffords  January 8  2011  attack  or the Virginia Tech attack  April 16  2007  But a ban of the firearm accessories is being pushed nonetheless AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
A host of National Public Radios Morning Edition asked Cameron Kasky  17  about young people who disagree with him about guns Ive read some really interesting op eds by students about your age who say  you know  Im growing up in rural America  Guns are part of my familys culture  I like target shooting  I dont think guns are a bad thing Noel King noted What do you say to a 17 year old who fundamentally disagrees with you about some of this stuff  King asked Well  I say were marching to protect you from other people like you who have guns  Kasky said  And I say that target shooting  while it is a sport  weve become the targets Were the targets now  Kasky said  We are running away from people like you The interview gave Kasky the opportunity to assert that the march  which is expected to draw as many as 500 000 to the nations capital and hundreds of other cities around the country and even some abroad  was still controlled by the students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland  Florida But when asked about the protests left wing supporters  Kasky admitted that adults helped pull off the D C  event  which requires a federal permit massive logistical support  and lots of money  including millions in insurance costs King  You are working with progressive groups  though  right   like Indivisible  which is a movement to resist the Trump agenda  You have dipped a toe into politics here Kasky then said race is an issue in school shootings Kasky  You know  our story was told because we are an affluent white community  And we have to shine the spotlight that was given on us on everybody in the world who has to deal with this on a daily basis  So people like Indivisible  who represent students who are in lower income communities and dont get to speak out the way we do because people dont listen  we have to connect with these students So the leadership of this movement still is teenagers  King asked Yes  Kasky claimed  And while we have people who help us  while we have people who can help us book hotels and get city permits  those arent the people controlling our message  Those arent the people writing our words  The only reason this has worked and the only reason this will continue to work is because we dont let ourselves get bastardized by others In fact  a wide coalition of left wing groups have been involved in organizing  promoting  and funding the march  including the anti gun group Giffords  Move On  and Womens March LA ,0

With strict gun control in place  Londoners are simply being stabbed to death  The Times describes a dramatic surge in knife crime On September 24  2014  Breitbart News reported that gun control had made Britain extremely violent  That gun control was put in place during the 20th century via a relentless  incremental push  which began with laws similar to firearm owner identification cards and background checks and ended with a virtual ban on all handguns This is how gun control was implemented Britain began placing restrictions on gun ownership after World War I with theFirearms Act of 1920  The passage of this act was emotionally driven  based in part on the publics war weariness and in part on the fear that an increased number of gunsguns from the battle fieldwould increase crime The Firearms Act of 1920 did not ban guns  Rather  it required that citizens who wanted a gun had to first obtain a certificate from the government  We see this same stage taking place in various places in the United States now  where a person who wants a firearm has to get a Fire Owner Identification Card  Illinois  or has to be vetted by police  Massachusetts  or both Thirteen years after the passage of the Firearms Act  British Parliament passed the Firearms and Imitation Firearms Bill  making the possession of a replica gun or a real one equally punishable unless the owner of either could show the lawful purpose for which he had it  This was followed by the Firearms Act of 1937  whichauthorFrank Miniter saysextended restrictions to shotguns and granted chief constables the power to add conditions to individual private firearm certificates In the U S  police departments in Massachusetts play the role Britains chief constables played and have final say on who can or cant own a firearm  On July 25 Breitbart News reportedthat that Massachusetts police were pressing for sole discretion on who could own a long gun  they already had such discretion over who could own a handgun  On August 1  they received the power they sought Britain continued to issue firearm certificates as World War II set in  But by the time the war was over  the gun control mindset had permeated society to a point where self defense was no longer a valid reason to secure a certificate for gun ownership Guns were simply for sport or for hunting In 1987  Michael Ryan shot and killed sixteen people in Hungerford  including his mother  He wounded fourteen others  then killed himself According to the Library of Congress  Ryan used lawfully owned rifles to carry out the attack  Nevertheless  his attack prompted the passage of more laws in the form of the Firearms Act of 1988  This act banned the possession of high powered self loading rifles and burst firing weapons  and imposed stricter standards for ownership to secure a government certificate to own a shotgun In 1996  Thomas Hamiltonwalked into an elementary school in Dunblane  Scotland  and shot and killed sixteen small childrenand their teacher in the gym before killing himself  He brought two rifles and four handguns to carry out the attack  All six guns were legally owned  Hamilton had fully complied with gun control statutes The Firearm Act of 1997 was passed while emotions ran high  Gun control proponents push for an all out ban on private gun ownership  in the much the same way that Senator Dianne Feinstein  D CA  reacted to the heinous crime at Sandy Hook Elementary by trying to ban approximately 150 different guns Yet the Firearm Act did not ban all guns  but served to essentially prohibit the ownership of handguns in Britain and to make the acquisition of certificate to possess a long gun an onerous and time consuming one In 2009  just 12 years after the passage of the Firearm Act  the Daily Mail described Britain as the most violent country in Europe  It reported that Britain had a worse rate for all types of violence than the U S On October 21  2017  Breitbart News reported that rapes in London were three times higher than in New York City Reported rapes are running three times higher in London than in NYC https t co oc60cWbDAZ  Breitbart London  BreitbartLondon  October 21  2017 Now  homicides in London are higher than homicides in New York City  and the man with a knife is king AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
Well Played  David Hogg For all of us on the right  it should have been a lightbulb moment on Friday  when David Hogg  the 17 year old student turned gun control activist  said to CNNs Alisyn Camerota  I think its great that corporate America is standing with me and the rest of my friends There  you heard it  In Hoggs view  corporate America aligns with the Parkland  Florida  students and their gun control alliesand that means  most immediately  a continued advertiser exodus from Laura Ingrahams show on Fox News Now of course  in reality  its impossible to make a blanket statement about corporate America on much of anythingincluding guns  For example  Wikipedia offers an extensive list of companies that have  and have not  cut ties with the National Rifle Association in the wake of the February 14 school shooting  And of course  there are all those gun manufacturers and retailers  So its simply not possible to say that corporate America speaks with one voice on guns  or on any other subject Still  as anyone following the gun debate knows  Hogg and his fellow March For Our Lives ersstudents and adult benefactors alikehave considerable momentum  including in corporate America The reality of that momentum became apparent last week  when a single tweet from Laura Ingraham boomeranged on the fiery Fox News host  On Wednesday  Ingraham tweeted mockingly about Hoggs college acceptance prospects For his part  within hours  Hogg responded with tweets of his own  calling upon advertisers to drop their sponsorship of Ingrahams show  And sure enough  some sponsors did just that Soon  Ingraham  obviously feeling the heat  apologized  And yet Hogg refused to accept Ingrahams apology  and so the anti Ingraham effort continues  as of this writing  Hogg is still on the offensive  Twitter wise  and 14 advertisers have fled  even as Ingraham suddenly announced that she was taking a vacation next week   In the meantime  the fact that Hogg himself had said far more intemperate things  including using profane language  has gone mostly unnoticed So this media exchange counts as a clear victory for Hogg   Co  He and his allies struck at Ingraham and Fox where it really hurtsin their bottom line  Speaking grandly of his establishment friends  Hogg also said to CNN on Friday  It is important that we stand together as corporate and civic America to take action against these people and show them they cannot push us around  especially when all were trying to do here is save lives Of course  some will argue  with plenty of evidence  that the flight of corporate advertisers from Ingraham and Foxas well as the distancing from the NRAhas been the result of a carefully coordinated pressure campaign run by politicos in Washington  DC  New York  and Los Angeles  not by students from Broward County  FL So this March 30 Breitbart News headline  Soros Funded Groups Fueling Laura Ingraham Advertiser Boycott  counts as what might be called a predictable surprise  In that piece  author Aaron Klein detailed the doings of Media Matters for America  funded by George Sorosand many other like minded fatcatswhile noting that Media Matters boasts some 80 employees  and an annual budget of about  13 million  That much throw weight  of course  can have a lot of impact  And so it might never be possible to untangle the role that Media Matters and like minded pressure groups have played in pushing at least some parts of corporate America toward a more pro gun control position Yet undeniably  some gun control activism comes from within corporate America itself  For instance  on March 2  BlackRock  the investment behemoth boasting  5 trillion in assets  announced that it was studying the possibility of using its financial muscle to influence gun issues  In fact  BlackRocks reach could potentially extend to virtually all aspects of gun manufacturing  financing  advertisingand boycotting As BlackRock CEO Larry Fink declared Companies must benefit all of their stakeholders  including shareholders  employees  customers and the communities in which they operate  And he added  companies must become more adept at understanding the societal impact of your business  Its hard to argue with Finks basic point about the desirability of social benefits  even as  of course  many might dispute Finks definition of those benefits Of course  a synonym for Finks societal impact is the more familiar phrase corporate social responsibility  CSR  CSR is a catch all term for just about anything a private firm might do  and yet in recent years  it seems that much CSR activism has been focused on selected issues  often having to do with gender and diversitysuch as  for example  the boycott of North Carolina over its bathroom bill  And now  these days  we can also add gun control To be sure  its hardly the case that corporate America has become a hotbed of leftism  there arent many Bernie Sanders supporters in the C suites  And yet at the same time  it seems evident that Clinton Obama type cultural liberalism has a firm foothold Not surprisingly  some on the right have reacted negatively to this liberalism  For example  on March 25  Derek Hunter  a veteran conservative writing for the rightist Townhall com  headlined his piece Our Corporate Masters Hunter expressed himself sharply  In the corporate world       they are trying to control what we can buy  what we can watch  what we can read  how we can spend our own money  what we can say  and how we live our lives Some might insist that corporations mostly just want to make money  and yet for some corporations  notably in Silicon Valley  making money seems to have been conflated with making a statementand yes  shaping our lives Exhibit A isyou guessed itFacebook  And a March 29 headline in Politico tells the tale of the right wing reaction  Conservative outlets take on Facebook  Those conservative outlets  of course  include Breitbart News  in the words of editor in chief Alex Marlow  Big tech is the biggest threat to free speech  Never has so much power been concentrated in the hands of so few people The Romans Had a Name for It Perhaps Virgil can add some perspectivethe wisdom  one might say  of an ancient So if we wish to ponder corporate social responsibility today  we might first take a closer look at that c word  corporation  As we shall see  a corporation has been  and will continue to be  highly variable  the only constant is that people operate themand people  too  are highly variable  Come to think of it  over time  they are 100 percent variable The word corporation dates back to the 15th century  its defined as persons united in a body for some purpose  The root of the word  of course  goes back even further  to the the Latin corpus  or body  which also gives us the modern word corpse These days  we likely think of a corporation as a private for profit company  And yet at the same time  there are public corporations  such as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting  and there are also private non profit corporations  such as the Carnegie Corporation In other words  a corporation is just a group of people organized to do something  with a twist  And that twist is this  The presumed goal for the corporation is to keep doing its thing well beyond the lifetime of any individualperhaps even forever  As the 18th century jurist Sir William Blackstone wrote in his magisterial Commentaries  Corporations  are artificial persons  established for preserving in perpetual succession certain rights  Blackstone observed that the legal structure of a corporation is  in fact  a body politic  He added that if such a legal structure were to be conferred only on natural persons  then the enterprise would fail in  the  process of timethat is  with the inevitable death of the participants Indeed  any conscious entity that lasts longer than the blink of historys eye is a kind of corporationthat is  all governments  all religions  all universities  all militaries  Thus we see the germ of that venerable idea in the name of the United States Marine Corps  as well as the Corps of Cadets at West Point So we quickly realize that a corporation of any kind is not much differentno better  no worsethan the people in it  To put that another way  corporations are simply a subset of human nature  for good or ill  And so the same is true for CSR  corporate social responsibility is just another manifestation of the personalities within a companyoften  in fact  more so than the owners of that company  who tend to be absentee  or even algorithmic  And of course  the people within a corporation are guided by whatever external laws and pressures they might confront Dont Mourn  Organize Its that last point  external laws and pressures  that we might dwell upon Today  if folks arent happy about the status quo of CSR and corporate activism  and they wish to see change  then they have no choice but to get active themselves Such activism can work for the right  even today  even in this cultural climate  Just on March 28  Walmart announced that it was pulling Cosmopolitan magazine from its checkout lanes  The retail giant acknowledged that it was responding to public pressure  specifically from the National Center on Sexual Exploitation  a conservative group  founded in 1962 as Morality in Media Indeed  the right might take useful inspiration from the left  specifically  the reputed last words of the legendary labor organizer  Joe Hill  who said to his followers in his dying moments  Dont mournorganize  You see  it does little good to simply lament the tears of thingsthat makes for great poetry  but not much else If every corporation  of every kind  is made up of people  then every corporation is subject to political pressure  that is  organized pressure  As the great Aristotle explains  man is a zoon politikona political animal  To put that another way  everything we do in the public square has a political component to it So if the right feels that the left is winningand it clearly is winning  at least on key cultural mattersthen the right had better improve its act  And in this case  act is short for both activism and action You see  politics can reshape anything and everything in our national life  Politics can change the risk reward calculation of companies that might  or might not  place advertising with Laura Ingraham  or with any other conservative  Politics can change the regulatory climate surrounding Wall Streeters such as BlackRocks Larry Fink  Politics can change the judiciaryit can even change  through amendment  our revered Constitution  In other words  every last aspect of todays CSR is subject to change  if theres the organized and concerted desire to change it Indeed  if one considers that the twin peaks of todays private sectorthat is  Wall Street and Silicon Valleyare both firmly in the hands of the cultural left  then it becomes all the more desirable  even necessary  for the right to stake its claim to effective national politics  That is  conservatives ought to control something that can affect Wall Street and Silicon Valley After all  its an article of faith on the right that most Americans agree with conservatives  at least quietly  on many critical issues  If so  then its time to prove it  Its time for the Silent Majority to become the Vocal Majority  And the Effective Majority  And if the path to majoritarianism requires some adjustment in the conservative message  well  so be it  Acting with calibrated deliberation in pursuit of a shared goal is  of course  the essence of politics  Everything else  no matter how heartfelt  is just posturing David Hogg and his Big Friends have won this round  Yet only time will tell who wins round two  and round three  and on and on  After all  just as politics is all surrounding  so  too  it is never ending Yes  its true what they say  There are no final victories  And yet still  always  victory is better than defeat ,0
Yet it is still fervently believed by many Democrats  who still refuse to accept any other explanation for Donald Trumps upset victory over Hillary Clinton  despite her own history of appeasing Russia And the bizarre Russian conspiracy theory is still nurtured by the mainstream media  who continue to find reds under every bed The latest example is a story by Tim Mak of National Public Radio that attempts to link Russia to the National Rifle Association  NRA  thus uniting the lefts two favorite narratives  Russian collusion and gun control Mak writes aboutAlexander Torshin  the deputy governor of Russias central bank and a prominent Kremlin linked Russian politician  who likes the NRA so much that he became a lifetime member and attended every NRA convention between 2012 and 2016  meeting Trump at the 2015 event Torshins NRA links were firstreported by McClatchy last month  His interest in the NRA might  quite innocently  be driven by an enthusiasm for firearms  he started a gun rights group in Moscow McClatchy suggested Torshin might be under investigation for funneling money to the NRA  ostensibly  to help Trump in 2016  but it could not say how much money  and the NRA denies it in any case Mak adds new scoops that Torshin himself had already published on his very active Twitter account  albeit in his native Russian tongue  whose use Mak describes as a nefarious plot to hide the truth behind a foreign language and sheer volume of tweets It all adds up to nothing  but the context is what matters Torshins use of NRA connections to open doors  and his 2015 claim to know Trump through the organization  raise new questions about the groups connections with Russian officials  at a time when the organization is being roundly criticized by its opponents  and at times the president himself  for being a factor in American gun violence  Mak says And thus the real purpose of the story is to link the Russians to the shooting in Parkland  Florida  via the NRA  which the left literally blames for the carnage Rep  Adam Schiff  D CA  has made similar arguments  suggesting Russian sponsored Facebook posts touting the Second Amendment were motivated by a desire to see Americans kill each other  as if the Second Amendment has no domestic support  as if patriots who love their guns are just Russian tools This attempt to turn the NRA into another cog in the Russian conspiracy is laughable  but the mainstream media apparently still find it deeply compelling   Mak tweeted his own article some ten times on Thursday Note that the media largely ignore Chinas efforts to influence the United States  not just through hacking and espionage  but also through investment and infiltration The reason  Trump confronts China openly  but is more circumspect about Russia  with which the U S  must cooperate in fighting Islamic terror  The media twist that strategic choice into a presumption of guilt  though they once lauded Barack Obamas brazen efforts to appease Russia Democrats and the media once believed McCarthyism  the search for Soviet Russian influence in every corner of our government and society  was a bad thing  Now they have revived it  internationalizing our domestic debates  and  ironically  helping Russia divide us more In that sense  the real tools of Russian influence are not Americans who have loved guns for centuries  but the politicians and journalists casting Second Amendment supporters as foreign enemies Joel B  Pollak is Senior Editor at Large at Breitbart News  He was named to Forwards 50 most influential Jews in 2017  He is the co author ofHow Trump Won  The Inside Story of a Revolution  is available from Regnery  Follow him on Twitter at  joelpollak ,0

In the years since the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre  the PTC found that overall violence on television jumped from 49 2 percent to 61 percent  of the 287 episodes examined  Gun violence jumped from 30 8 percent to 39 percent The time periods studied took place in the month after Sandy Hook in 2012 and the month after the Las Vegas music festival massacre in November of 2017 All of the TV shows studied ranged from TV PG to TV 14  In one of four of these shows  the V rating  warning parents about violence  was missing The question is not Do movies and television affect human behavior  Of course they do  Since its creation  popular mass culture has affected everything from fashion to language to tastes and attitudes  Advertisers spend billions of dollars on television to manipulate human behavior  Why  Because it works Rather  the question is what are we going to do about it Will we choose freedom or censorship  With the full understanding of the downside of artistic freedom  I choose freedom because those downsides are always preferable to the downsides of the government censorship and control  I would rather take my chances in a free country than live with the alternative The question of censorship  however  has nothing to do with the question of Hollywoods responsibility While NRA members quietly sell and trade guns in their own subculture  as they quietly go hunting or target shooting  it is Hollywood that is sexualizing guns  presenting gunfire as a solution to problems  and doing so using the most powerful propaganda device ever created  the moving picture Hollywood should not be blamed for gun violence  Decent people understand that no one other than the individual who committed the act is the one responsible  Moreover  it is neither appropriate nor American to use the criminal behavior of others to emotionally blackmail innocents into giving up their individual rights  But Hollywood does not see it that way  Hollywood disagrees  which is why the entertainment industry has launched a jihad against the NRA and the individual rights of law abiding gun owners Meanwhile  this very same Hollywood not only refuses to voluntarily do its part to tone down the glamorization of gun violence  but Hollywood is increasing that glamorization Hey  I love Hollywoods sex and violence as much as anyone  but I am not the one openly calling for the government to infringe on the personal freedoms of others Maybe before Hollywood takes our firearms away  they should take their own guns away  those up on the screen presenting gun violence as necessary  cool  and oh so climactic Hollywood heal thyself Follow John Nolte on Twitter  NolteNC  Follow his Facebook Page here ,0

He stressed that attention ought to be focused on banning bump stocks and instituting universal background checks  along with other gun controls It should be noted that bump stocks were not used in the Florida high school shooting and the attacker  Nikolas Cruz  acquired his gun at retail via a background check Deutch said The shift to arming teachers is a distraction from the important discussion about all of the things that can be done right now  this week  when we go back to Washington  on mental health  banning bump stocks  universal background checks  preventing people on the terror watch list from getting guns Sen  Bill Nelson  D FL  also pushed terror watch list gun control in the wake of the heinous Florida school shooting  In fact  Nelson pushed it before the number of casualties from the shooting were known  But Cruz was not on a terror watch list  so this gun control would not have done anything to prevent the attack Rep  Deutch also supports banning assault weapons  stressing his position that a ban on semi automatic assault  rifles  is a way to make students safe  This overlooks the April 16  2007  Virginia Tech attack in which 32 individuals were shot to death by a killer armed with a handgun in a gun free zone In other words  regardless of the type of weapon  individuals who attack gun free zones have the upper hand  and this is why President Trump is pushing to arm teachers It is inhumane to demand that educators likewise be sitting ducks AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

The left wing Axios sat down for a conversation with David Hogg  the gun control crusader the anti gun media have made the most visible since a gunman massacred 17 people at his former high school According to Axios  Hogg is upset with some of the new security protocols Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School is putting into place in the aftermath of last months mass shooting  Students will now be required to use clear  see through backpacks only The backpacks will be provided for free to students  The reason for the clear backpack is obvious  to make it more difficult to sneak a weapon on campus  The school is also considering metal detectors Hogg  however  is upset about this infringement on his backpack rights  tellingAxios  After we come back from Spring Break  theyre requiring us all to have clear backpacksits unnecessary  Its embarrassing for a lot of the students The irony here is remarkable  The same David Hogg who is stridently running around the country calling for further restrictions on every Americans Second Amendment civil rights is upset over a common sense security protocol many other schools and all kinds of retail workers have dealt with for decades When you walk into a government building  be it a courthouse  statehouse  or school  you are voluntarily giving up some of your privacy rights The idea that we are not treating school security like we do airport security is madness There is not a single proposed gun law that would have stopped any of these mass school shootings  Security is the only move that makes any sense whatsoever  but Hogg seems to believe he would be safer with faraway legislation than with hardened security measures at his own school door Follow John Nolte on Twitter  NolteNC  Follow his Facebook Page here ,0

Wednesday on MSNBCs Morning Joe  Sen  Ted Cruz  R TX  got into a heated debate with co host Joe Scarborough over the 2008 Supreme Court ruling in Heller v  District of Columbia  which protected theSecond Amendment right to possess a firearm Cruz said  If you want to ask common sense what we ought to be asking is what actually stops violent crime  We had a so called assault rifle ban  The Department of Justice studied that so called ban and found it had no effect on violent crime  It is a great Democratic talking point  An assault rifle is not a machine gun  Machine guns are functionally legal  They have been for over 80 years  What that call an assault weapon is a scary looking gun  It doesnt make it any more dangerous  If you want to stop crime  Scarborough interrupted  Wait  It actually  the studies show that weapons like the AR 15 are actually designed to be more lethal Cruz said  The lethality is distinguishable from many deer rifles Scarborough shot back  So your argument here is deer rifles are just as lethal if somebody takes a deer rifle into a high school in Parkland  that deer rifle is going to be as lethal as an AR 15 Things got heated whenScarborough said  You know every American doesnt have a constitutional Second Amendment right to carry an AR 15  yes or no When Cruz saidthe Supreme Court is allowing the issue to percolate  Scarborough replied  Senator  there are a lot of people  lawyers right now  who are rolling their eyes at what youre saying Cruz said  My career was litigating before the Supreme Court  I recognize this is not what you do Scarborough said  I dont need you to lecture me on what the Supreme Court does and what it doesnt do  You can talk down to me all you want to He added  Even a dumb country lawyer like me understands that an AR 15 today is not recognized as a constitutional right of Americans under the Second Amendment h tThe Hill Follow Pam Key on Twitter  pamkeyNEN ,0
The left is  as usual  demanding gun control  and it has enlisted several students from the school in its cause Actually  the students are  like the rest of America  divided on the issue  but apparently only the students who support gun control are earning national media headlines and support from politicians and parents One can understand the desire to do something  anything  to prevent another terrible event  but once again it is unclear what law or regulation would stop mass shootings Outlawingassault weapons  Automatic weapons are already largely illegal  and are not involved in most mass shooting events  The last assault weapons ban did nothing to stop mass shooting events  including Columbine Banning the AR 15  a single pull  single shot weapon falsely described as an assault weapon  The Charleston shooter murdered his victims atthe church with a handgun  Stephen Willeford  the hero who stopped the Texas church shooter last year  did so with an AR 15 rifle Gun violence restraining orders  GVROs  These arosein California after the Isla Vista shootingin 2015  to allow relatives of a troubled person to have policetake their guns away  But theseorders are only temporary  The Sandy Hook shooters mother gavehim his guns And in Parkland  the parents who took the killer in had no idea he wasso troubled  They told reporters that he had been showing improvement  and thought they had locked his guns away Improved background checks  That mighthelp  although that solution depends on the ability of the bureaucracy to manage databases properly  which it failed to do in the case of the Texas shooter  who never should have been able to buy a gun Andjust as in Parkland  many other mass shooters  including Islamic terrorists  have previously been reported to law enforcement or the FBI  but have either been ignored  or have been left alone after abrief inquiry As Attorney General Jeff Sessions told Breitbart News last week  there are signals and signs before these shootings that  if recognized  could lead to intervention  and could stop these events from occurring  They are being missed So  what new gun laws or regulations would actually prevent mass shootings There is one possibility  but the left will not allow us to tryit  namely  allowing teachers to carry guns Last year  five largelyrural California school districts adopted policies to allow teachers with concealed carry permits to bring their weapons on campus  so that they could respond to any active shooting situation that might arise  and  more likely  deter one from happening In response  the Democrat dominated California legislature passed  and Governor Jerry Brown signed  a law to delete the authority of a school district superintendent  his or her designee  or equivalent school authority to provide written permission for a person to possess a firearm within a school zone We will never know if the districts policy would have helped prevent shoot shootings because California Democrats never gave it a chance And so  thanks to Democrats and the media  we are reduced to debating gun laws and regulations that we knowwould not have prevented the shooting in Parkland  or elsewhere The best that can be said of these ideas is theymightprevent future mass shootings  But most new gun controls would also come at the heavy cost ofinfringing a fundamental constitutional right  and of stripping law abiding citizens of the ability to defend themselves Joel B  Pollak is Senior Editor at Large at Breitbart News  He was named to Forwards 50 most influential Jews in 2017  He is the co author ofHow Trump Won  The Inside Story of a Revolution  is available from Regnery  Follow him on Twitter at  joelpollak ,0

This came as Stephanopoulos tried to find a way to describe the NRA as endorsing a certain level of gun control Business Insider reported that he brought up President Trumps push to raise the minimum age of long purchases from 18 to 21  and noted that the NRA had spoken against the move  Loesch responded  Thats what the NRA came out and said  thats correct He also pressed Loesch on legislative and executive efforts to ban bump stocks and Loesch said  The NRA doesnt back any ban  She explained that the NRA asked the ATF to re examine its position on bump stocks  but remained steadfast against a legislative ban or executive action Loesch presented the NRA a group that is being maligned out of political expediency while the Broward County Sheriffs Office is given a pass on their alleged failure to prevent  or at least cut short  the February 14 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School attack  Moreover  Loesch explained that the knee jerk reaction of the left is always more gun control  even in situations where killers complied with gun control to acquire their weapons  And she warned that the current push to ban AR 15s is really the beginnings of a push to ban all semiautomatic rifles Ironically  Sen  Bill Nelsons  D FL  assault weapons ban targets the AR 15 plus over 200 rifles  The targeting of over 200 rifles appears to make Loeschs point AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

Fox 61 quoted Malloy saying  They act quite frankly in some cases as a terrorist organization  He said the NRA was for universal background checks in the 90s but is against them now  hoping this somehow bolsters his claim of terrorist organization What Malloy did not say is that a background check requirement for retail point of sale has been the law of the land since 1998  And nearly every mass public attacker of recent memoryincluding the Florida school gunmanhas acquired his or her firearm via such a check  So what is the point of expanding the frequency of checks to include more points of sale  To include private sales as well as retail These are the types of questions that Democrats try to avoid when pushing universal background checks They do not want to discuss the fact that a check system will never stop a latent criminal  only an actual one  But this is not lost on would be criminals  who know that if they avoid a criminal record they can pass a background check  legally purchase a gun  then use it criminally when the time suits them Does understanding this make the NRA a terrorist organization Here is something else the NRA understandsbecause background checks have already failed  the ceaseless push to expand them must really be about something other than background checks  The example of California shows that instituting universal background checks leads to compiling a gun registry which finally results in the creation of gun confiscation laws  In other words  universal background checks are the beginning of a slippery slope New Mexico sheriffs warned about this last year when Michael Bloomberg sponsored gun control groups pushed universal background checks in their state  Breitbart News reported that 32 of New Mexicos 33 sheriffs penned a letter warning that universal background checks would lead to gun registration in the state Surely no one would consider the 32 New Mexico sheriffs a terrorist organization for rejecting insidious gun control AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

On the eve of a left wing orchestrated event called March for Our Lives  an adult led protest that uses students to advocate for gun control  Runcie defends the PROMISE policy that drove down the number of minority student arrests and suspensions in his school district by allowing threatening and even violent behaviors to go unreported In a column at the Sun Sentinel  Runcie who once worked for President Barack Obamas education secretary Arne Duncan in Chicago mocks the attention paid to the Obama era Dear Colleague letter that coerced school districts into adopting the policy as a means to supposedly end the school to prison pipeline for minority students The Obama administration threatened school districts with the possibility of federal investigation and loss of funding if their statistics showed disproportionately more minority students arrested and suspended than white and Asian students  The Obama administration praised Runcies PROMISE program and likely considered it a model for the rest of the country Nevertheless  the Broward County superintendent would prefer the focus to be on easy access to guns as the reason Cruz was able to obtain his firearm Runcie denies his PROMISE program was at all instrumental in Cruzs shooting Contrary to media reports  the district has no record of Nikolas Cruz committing a PROMISE eligible infraction or being assigned to PROMISE while in high school  he writes PROMISE is partof the districts Code Book for Student Conduct   Discipline Policy  It is an intervention program for 13 specific non violent  misdemeanor infractions  such as petty theft under  300  trespassing  vandalism  alcohol use and disruption of campus The district has alwaysbeen explicitly clear that we have no policies that limit or tie the hands of law enforcement in doing its job in addressing school safety Max Eden  a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute  however  tells Breitbart News Runcies explanation warrants a closer look Runcies careful formulation contains a falsehood  several omissions  and obfuscations  Eden says  It doesnt covermiddle school  where Cruz racked up about two dozen offenses and was transferred into an intensive behavior management school  without ever gettingan arrest record Runcie claims that PROMISE only covered non violent offenses  Eden observes  Thats just straight false  The 2013 version covered assault and fighting  the 2016 version covered affray  i e  fighting  That means Cruzs fights were only deemed non PROMISE eligible based on administrator discretion  not policy Given that Cruz is alleged to have threatened students  its also worth noting that threats are a PROMISE eligible offense  he continues  Perhapsthose incidentswerent recorded as threats  Students have reported that Cruz brought bullets and knives to school  Perhaps those incidents werent recorded at all  Or perhaps they were andRuncies statement eludes them  the discipline matrix doesnt highlight Class B Weapons as a PROMISE eligible Incident Eden urges a careful look at the hurdles Runcie built into the new discipline matrix After failing to get Cruzinvoluntarily committed to a mental institution  the school developed a plan  dont let him bring a backpack because maybe hell kill everyone  he explains Then he commits an assault  Used to be  there were four categories for assault and you could call the cops forthree But now  there were three categoriesand you could only call the cops for the most serious form of assault So  despite everything about his record and insane behavior  policy prohibited administrators from sending him to law enforcement when he committed that assault  three weeks before he legally bought an AR 15 The 2016 PROMISE collaborative agreement among the school district  law enforcement  and community partners  such as the NAACP  also resolves that the parties follow the letter and spirit of the ESSA  federal Every Student Succeeds Act  provisions to reduce exclusionary disciplinary practices  while implementing prevention and intervention programs for children and youth who are neglected  delinquent  or at risk The parties will also follow the Department of Justice and Department of Education Guidelines on School Climate and Discipline  the PROMISE agreement states At a recent Heritage Foundation panel focused on the reported disorder that has resulted from the Obama era school leniency policy  U S  Civil Rights Commissioner Gail Heriot  a professor of law at the University of San Diego School of Law  observed that the Obama administration essentially told schools that if teachers and principals are disciplining proportionally more African American students than white or Asian students  were coming after you with massive investigations and threats to cut off your funding Under this approach its not actual race discrimination that gets schools in trouble  Heriot noted  Its having bad numbers Nobody disputes that African American students are disciplined at higher rates than white students or Asian students nationally  she observed  But what if the reason for that is that African Americans misbehave more often  and what if the cost of failure to discipline those students falls on their fellow African American students who are trying to learn amid classroom disorder Heriot also emphasized that white students get disciplined at rates higher than Asian studentsand that boys get disciplined at higher rates than girls Yet  no one seems very interested in those bad numbers  she asserted According to Heriot  it is virtually undisputed that students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to misbehave in school than students from middle class backgrounds However  the U S  Civil Rights commissioner said research shows that prior problem behavior is the best predictor of who will get suspended from school  and not race She observes the Obama era policy has produced two severely negative effects First  its caused schools to back away from discipline generally  with the result of more chaotic classrooms  Second  it has led to real discrimination  where white and Asian students on the one hand  and African American students on the other  operate under different discipline rules  all in order to make the numbers look good Heriot urges the Trump U S  Education Department to withdraw the Dear Colleague letters establishing the lenient discipline policy and put teachers and principals back in charge ,0

The conservative movement leaders wrote to Sessions in a letter obtained exclusively by Breitbart News Disney and 21st Century Fox are seeking Justice Department approval for one of the largest media mergers in American history  The proposed consolidation raises obvious 1st Amendment concerns  as a new Disney Fox company would control a substantial portion of the U S  entertainment market Given Disneys long track record of bullying its competitors  we are deeply concerned that such a merger would also consolidate the two biggest Hollywood studios creating family friendly content  the letter also says  adding  As DOJs Antitrust Division weighs the merits of this proposal  we ask that it examine closely the behavior of Disney and Fox toward their competitors specifically with regard to family friendly entertainment Leaders who signed the letter to Sessions include Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council  Dr  James Dobson of Family Talk  former Sen  Jim DeMint  American Values President Gary Bauer  Americans for Limited Government President Rick Manning  Cross Church senior pastor Dr  Ronnie Floyd  Parents TV Council President Timothy Winter  ForAmerica President David Bozell  Traditional Values Coalition President Andrea Lafferty  Eagle Forum President Eunie Smith  Hope Christian Church bishop and senior pastor Harry Jackson  Alabamas Wetumpka Tea Party President Becky Gerritson  the president of the National Center on Sexual Exploitation Patrick Trueman  columnist Rebecca Hagelin  Media Research Center President Brent Bozell  and Protect Family Rights founder Bill Aho The letter comes as the Department of Justice reviews the proposed merger  one of the biggest consolidations of media content creation in American historyand one of at least two major looming media mergers before the Justice Department right now  Conservatives are concerned that the consolidation of media power in just a few corporate hands could have devastating effects on American culture In 2005  in the face of vehement opposition from Disney  Congress passed the Family Movie Act  largely codified at 17 U S C   110 11  they wrote to Sessions  continuing Congress was compelled to offer this protection to American consumers because Hollywood had attempted to drive out of business every company that enabled parents to protect their children by filtering mature content families watched in the privacy of their homes  Indeed  Hollywood had refused to make any concessions  even declining to make the cleaner airline versions of movies available for private home viewing  This anti competitive behavior was and is designed to preserve Disneys and Foxs preeminent positions as the leaders in family friendly entertainment by wiping out companies that might clean their competitors content  thus allowing their rivals to compete in both the mature and family friendly market segments simultaneously This letter comes as a new survey from Rasmussen Reports that found that the public by and large believes violent movies and video games make America a less safe place The Rasmussen survey  the Washington Examiners Paul Bedard noted  found more than half of Americans blame violent movies and video games for making America a more hostile place That finding follows a report issued Monday by the Parents Television Council that said 61 percent of prime time shows aired during the recent sweeps week included violence  Bedard wrote this week  And 39 percent of 287 episodes included gun violence The Parents Television Council study calls on Hollywood to drop its regular underwriting  of  nightly dress rehearsals of gun violence on television In recent days  news outlets have reported that a number of corporations are severing ties with the NRA following the tragic events in Parkland  Florida  Winter  the president of Parents Television Council  said in announcing the study that exposes widespread violence in Hollywood culture He also said We call on those same corporations  and  indeed  we call on all corporate advertisers to ensure their media dollars are not underwriting bloody gun violence on television  Corporations that eschew gun violence must not be hypocrites by sponsoring simulations of gun violence on television  especially during the hours when children are likely to be in the viewing audience The letter to Sessions from the top movement conservatives notes that Disney and Fox have been fighting filtering technology that parents can use to remove mature content like swear words and adult scenes from otherwise family safe movies and shows  something for which they have received enormous support from the widely viewed as out of control Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that President Donald Trump just bashed the other day Filtering technology allows parents to remove specific elements of mature content such as violence  strong language  or sexually inappropriate images and sounds from movies and TV shows they watch in private  the conservatives wrote to Sessions  adding Disneys  and Foxs  continued efforts to drive the filtering industry out of business is a hot topic among family advocacy groups  whose members especially want to protect their children from messages encouraging sexual objectification  The Family Movie Act  enacted when DVDs were the prevailing private viewing technology  escaped legal challenge until recently  when consumer preferences swung dramatically in favor of streamed content and away from the inconvenience and limitations of watching DVDs  At the urging of Disney  Fox  and Warner Bros  the federal courts in the 9th Circuit have now interpreted the Family Movie Act as providing no protection for streaming motion pictures filtered as requested by each viewer Instead of helping families get family friendly content  the conservatives argue in the letter to Sessions  Hollywood has been trying to foist its value system onto the rest of America The studios are instead trying to push Hollywood values into the homes of middle America  the conservatives write  In doing so  they have ignored alarms raised by groups such as the Parents Television Council  whose research has shown that the major streaming platforms  such as Amazon  Google  and Netflix  are unsafe for children and lack adequate parental controls  Importantly  Disneys and Foxs efforts to block filtering have not been limited to the courts but have extended to blatant abuse of their monopoly power  They negotiated a protective bargaining agreement with the Directors Guild of America that obligates all studios subject to that agreement to prevent any modification of contentas occurs when a film is filtered  They have refused to enter into a streaming license agreement with any company that allows consumers to watch filtered content  even if that content is filtered at the consumers specific direction  And their contracts with the streaming services they do license obligate those services to prevent third partiessuch as VidAngel  ClearPlay  and othersfrom filtering their content on modern streaming devices  They have thus unlawfully sought to prevent all competition from companies that filter streamed content  As you consider the proposed Disney acquisition of 21st Century Fox  we urge you to evaluate the extent to which these companies abide by the spirit and the intent of the Family Movie Act by allowing consumers to use services that inexpensively filter harmful and explicit content from streamed media content they purchase ,0
For example  Brandon Gillespie  the Rocklin High School junior from the Sacramento area who has organized the  ProLifeWalkout event  noted that his school officials  for more than a week  delayed letting him know if he would get the same support for his event that anti gun activists received for theirs They are not giving me any accommodation at all  except for the district policy of not punishing students for protesting  Gillespie said in a statement  That is not the accommodation that I asked for  I asked for the same accommodation as the anti gun protest  that teachers would be flexible in their lesson planning  and also for the availability of equipment that the anti gun protestors were allowed to use Gillespie said he was not surprised by the school districts decision not to sanction the pro life walkout or give him the accommodations they gave the anti gun activist students It just confirms for me that there is a political double standard  at least in my school

Already a number of the children  those who witnessed last weeks shooting massacre at a high school in Parkland  Florida  have made countless appearances on the anti Trump cable network  In furtherance of its anti gun propaganda push  CNNs anti Trump pundit  Jake Tapper  will host a town hall Wednesday night featuring these children Many  however  see CNNs use of these minors as an act of partisan exploitation that is not only immoral  but also not good for the mental health of children so soon after they have witnessed such a traumatic event Appearing on Fox News  the Federalists Mollie Hemingway said  Theres been unfortunate media handling of these traumatized children  Theyve used them as ways to enact what they always like to do  a gun control agenda  she said before referencing CNNs upcoming town hall  These children arent forcing their ways on to CNN  town halls  or covers of magazines  Media is choosing them to put there  to shut down debate and keep people from having a conversation about gun control Truth Revolt also singled out CNN   The childrens  outrage is more than understandable after witnessing a mass shooting and fearing for their lives  but its shameful that CNN  and many other leftist outlets  would exploit them over and over again online and on air to push the medias gun control agenda The Federalist asks  What if putting traumatized teenagers on TV is not healthy But what if putting traumatized teenagers  mere days removed from a shocking and life changing event  in front of cameras and crowds is not healthy  Have we thought that through  the Federalist asks  before closing with this  Leave the kids alone  Its our job to lead  not theirs In her syndicated column  Michelle Maklin writes  Many  of these children  may be exceptionally smart  passionate  and articulate beyond their years  but they do not possess any semblance of wisdom because they have not lived those years  Their knowledge of history  law  and public policy is severely limited  And their moral agency and cognitive abilities are far from fully developed She adds  Most are in no position to change the world when they cant even remember to change their own bedsheets  Yet   Lawrence  Tribe relishes the opportunity to hide behind the young Parkland activists headed to CNNs propaganda town halls At National Review  Ben Shapiro writes  CNN plans a full primetime special with the victims classmates  parents  and community members  What  pray tell  Shapirios asks  did these students do to earn their claim to expertise  They were present during a mass shooting  and they have the right point of view  according to the Left Singling out CNN  Shapiro points out that Theres a reason that producers at CNN are eager to put  high school  junior Cameron Kasky in front of the cameras  He says things like Youre either with us or against us  It seems a stretch to think that if Kasky were instead advocating for more armed school security  CNN would be breaking into its primetime lineup to air his views Talking about CNN and other left wing news outlets  National Reviews Dan McLaughlin writes  Im never in favor of the whole spectacle of using kids as political props  which both sides do  but its one thing when its relatively benign stuff  a politician campaigning with his family  Those arent efforts to use kids as human shields against hard questions being asked in a serious public policy debate Hot Airs John Sexton believes CNN is feeding these traumatized children talking points  Perhaps whats most striking is how closely some of  student Emma Gonzalez  points seem to mirror talking points tweeted out a couple days earlier by  wait for it  CNN  Its almost as if CNN is feeding the students information for the events it then covers as the authentic voice of the students Sexton also worries if CNN is exploiting these kids to promote its agenda  Is it odd to anyone else that a CNN news story about student gun control efforts features a segment promoting CNNs own town hall event  Is CNN reporting here or promoting an agenda When Tapper himself  the former Salon writer and host of CNNs upcoming anti gun town hall  was criticized for using traumatized teenagers  he avoided the subject by accusing his critic of lying Twitter user  kengardner11 tweeted to the left wing Tapper  Using traumatized teenagers who dont even yet know enough to have coherent political views as emotional props to push a particular political agenda is not healthy or logical Tapper fired back with a non sequitur  You said something demonstrably false and now youre trying to change the subject Gardner replied  Umreally  What did I say that you claim that was demonstrably false  Demonstrate it to me  But focus on what I actually said Tapper was then forced to change the subject  arguing that Gardner accused him of bias  When Gardner challenged Tapper to point out where he did this  Tapper abruptly shut down the discussion   T his doesnt seem a conversation youre trying to have in good faith  so adios  Have a great weekend  Tapper snarked Umreally  What did I say that you claim that was demonstrably false  Demonstrate it to me  But focus on what I actually said  If you do  this wont take long  Ken Gardner  KenGardner11  February 18  2018 I was about to answer this again   it was about how just a few hours ago i was defending a kid who spoke in favor of having his teacher armed  The point was people shouldnt attack  they should debate  But now I see your other tweets about me  So I dont really see the point  Jake Tapper  jaketapper  February 18  2018 You suggested i would never voice such support for anyone who publicly took a conservative position  I literally had done so minutes before   But again  this doesnt seem a conversation youre trying to have in good faith  so adios  Have a great weekend  Jake Tapper  jaketapper  February 18  2018 Tappers intellectual dishonesty has been the typical response from CNN to those criticizing the last place network for using children  who are obviously traumatized  as a means to push its anti gun agenda Rather than address the actual issue at hand  Is it appropriate to use children as young as 14 in this way   CNN manufactures arguments its critics did not make or focuses on straw men  like a few conspiracy theorists claiming these children are actors CNN has yet to address the matter directly or to bring mental health experts on the air to discuss it Follow John Nolte on Twitter  NolteNC  Follow his Facebook Page here ,0

It is courageous to stand for freedom against government tyranny  especially when your peers are receiving breathless praise from the nations media outlets  This is why you  as the vast majority of Americas youth  should not remain silent as your fellow students claim to speak for you in demanding that your right to self defense be given away  Your right to self defense is not theirs to give It seems that Saturdays anti gun march found few  if any  people who value liberty  Unlike other civil rights marches in U S  history  Saturdays gun control rally was really an anti civil rights rally  it was an entirely un American experience  These marchers seek not to expand your freedoms  but to deprive you and your family of your fundamental right to self defense  And just like retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens argued yesterday  many of the marchers desire the elimination of the Second Amendment  which guarantees your individual right to effective self defense Dont be fooled  You should never give away your right to defend yourself and those you care about  Once gone  you will never get this right back What is the best proof that good guys with guns stop bad guys from doing bad things  Well  how about we look to the hypocrite celebrities  plutocrats  and politicians  who are surrounded by legal  armed mercenaries  known as their security details  but want you and your peers to give up your rights to defend yourself Their game is simply a con  Tell them to get rid of their armed guards first  When they speak about gun control  what theyre really saying to you is  Guns for me  but not for thee  Tell those anti gun hypocrites rich enough to hire their own armed security teams  You first These march organizers and sponsors are not your friends  When they say we should stand up to the NRA  what theyre really asking is that your government prevent millions of people from defending themselves against bigger  stronger  and quicker criminal predators  This means your grandparents  your moms  and your girlfriends will have no reasonable way to defend themselves Real life is not a Hollywood movie  The Atomic Blonde  Charlize Theron  cant take out a half a dozen East German security agents  superhero Scarlett Johanasen cant beat up a man twice her size When the latest protest march ends  many of these anti gun hypocrites will go home to their secure well guarded compounds  and you will just go home  No armed guards and electric gates for you And for those who may think theyre sticking it to the man by begging politicians to take away your civil right of self defense  the reality is that this is exactly what the man wants to do  You are insuring your own helplessness If you enjoy being helpless  then this ginned up anti gun childrens crusade is the perfect cause for you Does a gun guarantee your safety  no  But it gives you a fighting chance against an armed or larger attacker The tragedy of the Parkland school shooting was a failure of the police  the FBI  and the school system  all of whom had multiple opportunities to stop the killer  Nikolas Cruz  Instead they all failed  Now they want to blame Guns  Of course they do  Otherwise theyd have to accept the blame themselves  Dont be a sucker and fall for this con Many of the same people who didnt protect the Parkland students want you to be unable to protect yourself  How can that make sense  All of this anti gun nonsense is simply to distract you from seeing the failure of those in authority  Why will it be different next time And who do they wish to punish for their mistakes and incompetence  The millions of law abiding and gun owning Americans who had nothing to do with the crime Nobody  except maybe your parents  is more interested in preserving your life than you are  Dont give up your only realistic life preserver  a firearm And dont imagine that your anti gun peers are currently being lionized by the media because of their intelligence  independence  and common sense  Being led around by the nose by sanctimonious celebs and politicians with their own political agenda shows neither courage nor leadership  It shows just the opposite Still not convinced that you shouldnt give up your right to a gun Then see what happens when you tell those well guarded billionaires and celebrities who want you to disarm  You First Mark W  Smith is an attorney and a bestselling author ,0
The proposed resolution also calls on Congress to ban the manufacture  sale  purchase  possession  and use of assault weapons It also asks to implement universal background checks  Suchchecks would require a background check for a private sale just like the background check currently required for a retail purchase  Ironically  almost every high profile firearm based attacker acquires his or her gun via background checks at retail sales  so such an expansion would do nothing to prevent future attacks To date  attackers that do not acquire firearms via background checks most often get their guns via thievery  For example  the Parkland  Florida  school attacker passed a background check for his rifle  while the Sandy Hook Elementary attacker stole his guns  Universal background checks would not have prevented either attack The proposed Richmond school safety resolution voices opposition to arming teachers for self defense  even as it calls for more gun control outside of schools  The resolution says  The School Board and  Richmond Public Schools  is opposed to the arming of teachers to protect schools and children Moreover  the proposed resolution calls for extending gun free school zones  It should be noted that Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School was not only a gun free zone but an ammunition free zone as well  yet none of these designations mattered to the gunman who was intent on taking lives of defenseless individuals The proposed resolution also calls on Congress to fund programs to educate students and their families on the dangers of firearms Richmond Times Dispatch reporter Justin Mattingly reports the school board is expected to take up the school safety resolution at its next meeting AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

Kimmels comments came toward the end of a teary eyed monologue in which he demanded more gun laws  real laws  but could not describe how such a law would work to prevent the kind of deadly shooting that occurred this week atMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School It followed a tirade in which he tried to shame House Republicansinto supporting gun control by describing them as allegedly Christian men and women who stuff their pockets with money from the NRA and in which he tried to shame the executive branch by suggesting that President Trump is mentally ill if he will not restrict everyones gun rights over the criminal act of Nikolas Cruz Tell these congressmen and lobbyists who infest that swamp you said you were going to drain  force these allegedly Christian men and women who stuff their pockets with money from the NRA year after year after year to do something  Kimmel said Now  not later  Now  And dont you dare let anyone say its too soon to be talking about it  because you said it after Vegas  you said it after Sandy Hook  you say that after every one of these eight now fatal school shootings we had in this country this year  Children are being murdered Kimmel pointed to the repeal of Barack Obamas Social Security gun ban  looked into the camera  as if speaking directly to President Trump  and said  You did that  Your party voted to repeal the mandates on coverage for mental health Actually  youve done worse than nothing  You like to say this is a mental health issue  One of your very first acts as president  Mr  Trump  was to roll back the regulations that were designed to keep firearms out of the hands of mentally ill  You did that  Kimmel said  Your party voted to repeal the mandates on coverage for mental health  So I agree  this is a mental illness issue  because if you dont think we need to do something about it  youre obviously mentally ill While this convoluted statement was clearly intended to suggest that President Trump and Republicans had something to do with Cruz acquiring a firearm  it overlooks the fact that the Social Security gun ban covered Social Security beneficiaries on disability who needed help managing their finances  On the basis of requiring help with their finances  such beneficiaries were prohibited from gun possession  That is no way applicable to the heinous attack on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School This is by no means the first time Kimmel has attempted to use shame and questionable claims to push a gun control agenda during his opening monologue On October 2  2017  the day after the heinous attack on the Las Vegas strip  Breitbart News reported that Kimmel made seven false or misleading statements about gun laws as part of a push to shame Congress into enacting increased gun control measures Those statements included suggestions that attackers were using automatic weapons  that AR 15s are not used for self defense  that President Trump enabled crazy people to get guns via the repeal of the Social Security gun ban  deja vu  that the NRA has Paul Ryans balls in a money clip  that people are exploiting loopholes to get guns privately It turns out that automatic weapons were not used  Paul Ryan responded to Vegas by shelving NRA supported  pro Second Amendment legislation  and the Vegas gunman bought all his weapons at retail  via background checks  not via private sales The repeal of the Social Security gun ban had zero to do with it Kimmel closed his monologue on Thursday by urging viewers to team up with Michael Bloomberg funded Everytown for Gun Safety and vote pro Second Amendment Congressional members out AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

On National Public Radios Weekend Edition Saturday  Host Scott Simon interviewed Republican Florida State Senator Dennis Baxley about legislation he sponsored to deal with school shootings like the one that took place at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Simon asked Baxley why his legislation did not include a provision to make a mental health assessment Baxley explained that he is adding such a provision to the legislation Ive actually pulled this bill back because I want to look at every option  Baxley said  What were dealing with is the fact with a gun free zone  we have inadvertently made these students a sterile target And they enter this campus knowing no one is prepared to stop them  Baxley said  And Im very interested in what happens in that first five minutes so that we could prevent an incident from becoming a massacre The interview as followed by one with Rep  Jackie Speier  D CA  who was apparently scheduled to respond to the latest FBI revelation that 13 Russian nationals have been indicted for interference in the 2016 presidential election But Speier wanted to respond to Baxleys interview  including blaming the National Rifle Association and gun ownership Im just furious that the NRA has so infiltrated every state legislature  the Congress of the United States that we cant even have a sane conversation  Speier said  The reason why 17 kids are dead today  and their parents are screaming and crying on TV  and there are another 15 injured is because that young man had an assault weapon  and he was able to discharge as many bullets as he did According to officials  three of the dead were adults on staff at the school Speier continued to press gun control and dismiss mental health issues in the interview We have got to start with putting back in place that assault weapon ban  Speier said  No kid needs an assault weapon No adult needs an assault weapon  Speier said  And weve got to do a whole lot more than that  but to somehow think that this is a mental health issue is just fundamentally ignorant So few of these cases would be addressed by a mental health screen  Speir said  And I think weve got to get real about this Simon also pushed the gun control narrative in his interview with Baxley Senator  I have to ask  is that really a reliable  practical way to try and cut down on school shootings  to tell students  dont worry  Someone will be along to shoot the guy whos trying to shoot you  Doesnt that seem just to invite more firepower  Simon asked No  Baxley said  What happens is we call law enforcement  and they get there as quick as they can  But in many settings  what happens in that first five minutes has already determined the direction of the event escalating Attorney General Jeff Sessions spoke about mental illnesss role in these kinds of events last week Breitbart News reported I believe very strongly in enforcing gun laws  I believe theres no value in having them on the books if theyre not prosecuted   Sessions  said He noted that federal gun prosecutions had increased 23  on his watch Well step that up even more  he said Rather than new gun legislation  Sessions suggested that new executive policies focused on mental health problems could make a difference We think that would include working with the mental health community  and the education community  and the homeland security community  he said Multiple sources have reported that 19 year old Nikolas Cruz had a history of mental illness and run ins with law enforcement before the attack Follow Penny Starr on Twitter ,0
A bump stock is not a firearm  it is a firearm accessory  The DOJ is declaring them to be machine guns in order to ban them A March 12 press release put forth by the DOJ  says The Department of Justice is supporting President Trumps absolute commitment to ensuring the safety and security of every American by submitting to the Office of Management and Budget a proposed regulation to clarify that bump stock type devices are machine guns under federal law  which will effectively ban the manufacture  sale or possession of these devices The push to ban bump stocks began in Congress almost immediately after the October 1  2017  Las Vegas attack  On October 6  just five days after the attack  Breitbart News reported that 11 Republicans supported some action on bump stocks  Those 11 were But the American people did not rally behind a bump stock ban  and the legislative pushes soon faded awaybut a push for the ATF to ban bump stocks by regulation remained alive buthopes for regulatory gun control  via the ATF  stayed alive  For example  the NRA encouraged Congress not to pass new laws while  at the same time  encouraging the ATF to re evaluate bump stocks  The NRAs position was that devices designed to allow semi automatic rifles to function like fully automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations The ATF began looking into redefining the term machine gun so that it referencedmachine guns and non machine guns as well This allows them to treat simple  plastic firearm accessories  like bump stocks  on par with actual conversion devices that change the action of firearms On March 10  Trumps DOJ announced it was close to finalizing a bump stock ban and on March 12 the DOJ made clear the ban will center onincludingplastic  barrel less stocks  trigger free stocks bump stock deviceswithin the definition ofmachine guns AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
Sunday on ABCs This Week NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch said the focus should not be on gun control but instead on the Broward County  FL Sheriffs Department for its actions leading up to and during the Parkland school shooting Loesch said  Can we look at what could have prevented this  That firearm didnt walk itself into the school  An individual who was allowed to go unchecked by the Broward County Sheriffs office allowed that firearm to go into the school  Its not the fault nor are 5 million law abiding Americans culpable for this She added  I wish that as much attention were given to the Broward County Sheriff and their abdication of duty as trying to blame five million innocent  law abiding gun owners all across the country Follow Pam Key on Twitter  pamkeyNEN ,0
His first stop was a Jimmy Johns right outside the White House  where Breitbart News spoke with him about the goals he wants to accomplish while in Washington  DC Setting aside his luggage  Kashuv paused when asked if he considers himself a survivor of the Parkland High School shooting  even though cable news has seized on the terminology to define his classmates The only people I think can be branded as survivors are people in the freshman building  unless you were in the freshman building or people who lost their best friends  he explains But as a student at Parkland  cable news has made his voice relevant in the conversation about guns and school safety  and he appears comfortable using it He had some criticism of the response from the cool club of students who quickly organized after the shooting and issued dramatic calls for gun control I think they had good intentions in the beginning  but I think it got corrupted  he said  It turned into anti guns  anti guns  anti guns  I think the solution is about more than just anti guns Generally  he is supportive of the  NeverAgain movement and plans to attend the march later this month  but he worries that it has become too narrowly focused on gun control Most of the attention he received is a result of Twitter After attending the student march in Tallahassee  Florida  he started speaking out on Twitter  That attracted attention from Trump supporters and supporters of the Second Amendment  who started raising his profile  Early attempts to get verified on Twitter failed  but after an exchange with Chelsea Clinton  he finally got the blue checkmark verified status I hate Twitter  I think its cancerous and a waste of time  he says wryly  despite his use of the social network to set up meetings with a bi partisan group of Congressional members By the time Breitbart News met with Kashuv  he had plans to meet with Sen  Chris Murphy  Sen  Marco Rubio  Sen  Chuck Schumer  and Speaker Paul Ryan  He also plans to meet with officials at the National Rifle Association  NRA Kashuv wants to visit with President Donald Trump  but has not heard back  to show him that some of the Parkland students are ready to have a conversation Part of his decision to speak out was a frustration that only one side of the political debate was being highlighted by the media  He is partially annoyed at David Hogg  whom he recalls meeting at a drone club meeting at schoolwhen school was just normal He thought it was absurd that Hogg boasted about hanging up on the White Houseaide who reached out to him to invite him to discuss gun control Look  I wasnt a fan of Obama  but if he reached out to me to talk about an issue I cared about  I would at least respectfully take the call  Kashuv said I dont think hes a bad dude  Kashuv added  although he said is annoyed that Hogg and his allies have focused their rage on branding the NRA as evil and sparking corporate boycotts of the organization I dont think it has to be like us versus them  I think on some issues we agree  leave the gun control debate out of it for now Kashuv said Attempts to reach out to the group in the spirit of inclusion have failed  although he says he is not concerned about their differing views Kashuvattended the student march in Tallahassee  Florida  but said it quickly devolved into a hegemony of elites and a closed group circle that excluded opposite opinions Kashuvsays he has many Republican friends and knows underground Trump supporters who agree with his reactions  but he admits that they do not want the negative attention to follow them for the rest of their lives He admits that he considered the risks of speaking out but ultimately decided he was not afraid I dont think Im doing anything like necessarily bad here  Kashuv said  Im just trying to voice my opinion He notes appreciatively that even some of his Democratic friends supported his decision to speak out Kashuv explains that his parents are largely apolitical  they are not gun owners or conservatives  He says that he arrived at many of his political opinions on his own by watching YouTube videos and reading articles on the internet He does not own a gun nor has fired a gun  but he would like to someday soon His opinions on the Second Amendment are largely theoretical but well informed as he cites self defense statistics and ridicules leftist activists for failing to have a basic knowledge of semi automatic firearms Kashuv said he is not interested in a life of politics or political activism but instead business  and he is trying to focus on school despite the shooting that disrupted everyones lives In his spare time  he trades cryptocurrency and does his schoolwork with plans to go to college for business Kashuv says his parents are supportive of his decision to speak out as long as he doesnt  A  Screw up my future and B  Stay on my homework The mention of homework reminds him of his school  and he admits that it is hard to focus after the shooting No one can focus  no one can  he says  admitting he is worried about the upcoming AP exams at school We gotta get those pushed back  he said lightly  reaching for his phone  Im going to call David Hogg about that right now But Hogg did not answer ,0

Trump has held several such meetings since the beginning of the year  beginning with a meeting on immigration in January  The events are virtually unprecedented in showing Americans a civil and open exchange of views on contentious issues among leaders  and  occasionally  ordinary citizens  on both sides of the political divide This meeting was different  however  in that the president was not just listening  but driving policy in a particular direction And that direction  perhaps to the dismay of some of Trumps core supporters  is toward gun control At one point  Trump dismissed a suggestion by House Majority Whip Steve Scalise  R LA   who was wounded last summer in a mass shooting targeting Republicans  to allow national reciprocity for concealed carry permits Trump told Scalise bluntly  I think that maybe that bill will someday pass but it should pass as a separate bill Youll never get this passed  If you add concealed carry to this youll never get it passed  Let it be a separate bill Trump defended the idea of raising the minimum age to purchase a rifle  at least  the AR 15 used in the Parkland  Florida shooting earlier this month  to 21  pointing out that handguns already had such an age requirement  but that the shooter had still been able to buy the rifle he used Trump acknowledged that the NRA was opposed to the proposal Im a fan of the NRA  Theres no bigger fan  Im a big fan of the NRA  These are great people  these are great patriots  he said  They love our country  But that doesnt mean we have to agree on everything Then  in an exchange that captured the attention of the mainstream media  Trump told Sens  Pat Toomey  R PA  and Joe Manchin  D WV  that they were afraid of the NRA after they told him that their bipartisan bill to expand background checks had not included a provision to raise the minimum age to purchase a rifle Toomey responded by defending the view that adults over 18 should be able to own rifles  My reservation about it  frankly  is that the vast majority of 18  19  and 20 year olds in Pennsylvania who have a rifle or a shotgun  theyre not a threat to anyone  Theyre law abiding citizens  They have that because they want to use it for hunting or target shooting  And to deny them their Second Amendment right is not going to make anyone safer The president acknowledged that argument  but went on to argue that Republicans should add Democrat ideas into one compromise bill  His emphasis was on expanding and improving background checks  but he was clearly open to more ambitious proposals  or at least wanted to be seen open to other ideas  He dismissed the idea of gun free zones  describing them as dangerous  but he also wanted to push gun control legislation forward How much of Trumps performance was theatre is anyones guess When asked by Sen  Dianne Feinstein  D CA  whether he would actually sign a bill to raise the minimum age for purchasing a rifle  Trump dodged carefully  Ill tell you what  Im going to give it a lot of consideration  and Im the one bringing it up  and a lot of people dont even want to bring it up  because theyre afraid to bring it up It is possible that Trump simply wanted to be seen as fighting the NRA  while at the same time bringing out the NRAs arguments  such as Toomeys response  in the mouths of other people  That way  Trump could cast himself as a leader on the issue  without committing to legal changes that would alienate a core part of his base But conservatives will  no doubt  worry about his apparent concessions to Democrats  and how far they could go Joel B  Pollak is Senior Editor at Large at Breitbart News  He was named to Forwards 50 most influential Jews in 2017  He is the co author ofHow Trump Won  The Inside Story of a Revolution  is available from Regnery  Follow him on Twitter at  joelpollak ,0

Tuesday on Fox News Channels Fox   Friends  former Speaker Newt Gingrich said the only long term solution to school shootings was to have teachers and administrators trained in the use of firearms and prepared to defend the kids Gingrichsaid  What I think is the only long term solution  which is to have  depending on the size of the school  a minimum of 6 to 8 teachers and administrators who are trained in the use of firearms and have concealed carry permits and are prepared to defend the kids  Weve had this experiment  I thought the sheriff from Florida said it perfectly when he said we have experimented with the gun free zone  Its called a school  Every school in the country is supposed to be a gun free zone  If gun control worked  how come it didnt work  We have to be realistic  We are not going to confiscate guns on the scale to make us a disarmed country He added  The truth issooner or later somebody is going to slip through the net the civil liberties problem if you go out and pick weird  you are really infringing on the right of people to be free Follow Pam Key on Twitter  pamkeyNEN  ,0

National reciprocity passed the House on December 6  2017  and the CBS News warns that passage in the Senate would mandate that the carry permit of any one state be recognized in every state  They turned to Robyn Thomas  with Gabby Giffords gun control group  and Thomas said  Someone who lives in Nevada  whos able to carry a loaded  concealed weapon in Nevada could now bring that loaded gun into Los Angeles  into San Francisco  and carry their loaded weapon  even though in San Francisco thats not someone who would get a permit Thomas statement gives the impression that national reciprocity allows people to carry who otherwise would not be able to do so  But this is a play on words  In reality  individuals who passed a background check to acquire a permit in Nevada have demonstrated they are legally able to carry  The reason they might not get a permit in San Francisco is because of gun control  not because of failing to show a clean criminal record California is actually a perfect example for why national reciprocity is needed  because law abiding Californians who demonstrate a lack of criminal record are nonetheless denied a concealed carry permit on grounds that they cannot show good cause for having one   In other words  being law abiding is not enough  In California you have to persuade the local sheriff that you are under duress  facing danger if unarmed Yet CBS News described guns as a security blanket for the hayseeds in flyover country In the red states that stretch from the Carolinas through the mountains of the far west  It is the political fault line of regional and cultural differences that split the country and guns are one of the triggers  Theyre woven into the culture here  passed down from generation to generation in rural  remote parts of the country where dialing 911 does not always bring immediate help  To people here  whether theyre single mothers worried about robbers and rapists while driving their kids across state lines to soccer matches  or ranchers worried about rattlesnakes  guns are a security blanket of self reliance and protection that keep them safe So tools that allow single mothers to fend off robbers and rapists in rural America somehow portend a rise in crime if carried into big cities and blue states In reality  national reciprocity only poses a threat to the top down gun control that currently keeps visitors to blue states and big cities disarmed AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
Mondayon ABCs The View  co host Whoopi Goldberg said Republican leaders like House Speaker Paul Ryan  R WI  and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  R KY  have not spoken out about the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting and calls for gun control legislation However  she noted they were not silent about NFL players kneeling during the nationalanthem Goldberg said  You know  yall were talking about Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan  and one of the things that I sort of heard over the weekend and was curious about is people kept saying where were the Republicans who should be talking to these kids and finding out whats going on  I thought to myself  well  maybe they dont have an answer  Maybe they dont have anything to say She continued  You know  when the athletes were kneeling  every Republican sort of had something to say  And its not a criticism  Im just wondering where theyve beenwhere they stand on this particular issue Co host Sunny Hostin added  I think when it comes to guns and gun control  people put their party before country  And I believe they put their quest to remain in power over the needs for community  You have these children that are in pain and struggling with that grief  and struggling to deal with things that no child should have to deal with  They are looking to the grown ups for guidance and assistance  and Republicans are the controlling party now  And I wish I heard more from a Paul Ryan  from leadership other than President Trump because I want to knowif these are fathers and mothers  what are they thinking Follow Pam Key on Twitter  pamkeyNEN  ,0

Five of the seven guns are brand new  while two are staples with recent changes that improved on something that was already great Two of the seven guns are perfect for home defense  with the other five being geared toward concealed carry Here they are Smith   Wesson M P 9 Shield M2 0The M P 9 Shield M2 0 is the newest version of the wildly popular Shield  The gun is noticeably refined  with a strong focus given to grip improvement and trigger quality  The Shield M2 0 is compact and can be purchased alone or with an Integrated Crimson Trace laser affixed to the front of the pistol  The Shield has been a concealed carry staple for years and with the M2 0  Smith   Wesson is making sure the gun remains a staple for years to come  The M P 9 Shield M2 0 costs approximately  480 Walther PPS M2The PPS M2 is not new to the gun community  but it is included in this list because it is a dependable  accurate firearm which caught our attention at SHOT Show  It is a pistol that is perfectly suited for daily carry  The pistols grip features a non slip  cross directional surface that inspires confidence and the sights are large enough to aid in target acquisition  but small enough to prevent the gun from getting snagged if being drawn under duress  The PPS M2 is chambered in 9mm and can be purchased alone or with an Crimson Trace laser affixed  The PPS M2 costs approximately  490 510 Smith   Wesson M P 40 Shield M2 0The M P 40 Shield M2 0 is like the 9  only chambered in  40  It is the same Shield quality  with the same grip and trigger improvements  but in slightly larger round  The 40 Shield M2 0 remains extremely compact at about 18 ounces  and  like the 9mm  can be acquired with a thumb safety for compliance with gun control laws in states like Massachusetts  The M P 40 Shield M2 0 costs approximately  480 Sig Sauer P365The air of the SHOT Show was abuzz over the introduction of the Sig Sauer P365  When we got to the Sig Sauer booth the pistol felt great in the hand  extremely balanced  and certainly compact enough for carrying 365 days a year  And the P365 brings a strong advantage over compacts of similar size in that it holds ten in the magazine plus one in the chamber  for 11 rounds  This is a round advantage of three over the Shield and of two over the PPS M2  The Sig Sauer P365 is chambered in 9mm and costs approximately  525 North American Arms GuardianThe North American Arms Guardian has been around for nearly 20 years  but the Guardian one can buy today has options that were not available for the Guardian that premiered in 2001  We came across one during SHOT Show 2018 with wide wooden grips from the factory  making the diminutive pistol fill the hand  The grips gave the pistol a tight and secure fit  not allowing it to wiggle in the hand  Newer styles of slide serration also made it even easier to pull back the slide and load a round into stainless steel pistol  The Guardian is a true pocket pistol chambered in  380  It costs approximately  450 Mossberg 590MThe Mossberg 590M is a brand new offering in home defense shotguns  From a distance it simply looks like a 12 gauge Mossberg pump shotgun  but up close one realizes the magazine tube is inert  The gun is loaded via detachable  double stack magazines rather than a fixed tube  Mossberg magazines will be available in 5  10  15  or 20 round capacity for the 590M  This is gives the gun owner a huge advantage over the common three to five rounds normally available via a tubular mag  The 590M is certain to lead to a large contingent of sight options  magazine variations  and other shotgun accessories in the aftermarket world  The suggested retail price of the upcoming 590M has not been announced UTAS UTS 15 SemiautomaticUTAS is well know for its 15 round capacity UTS 15 pump shotgun  which is a tremendous tool for home defense  The gun has two tubular magazines fitted and offset above the barrel  each holding 7 rounds  with one in the chamber making a total of 15 rounds  At SHOT Show we were able to see the upcoming UTS 15 semiautomatic  It was like the 15 cosmetically  differing only in the fact that the action does not depend on a pump  Rather  the gun feeds itself a round every time a shell is fired  Very little information was available on the weapon  but it is certain to take home defense to a whole new level AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

Wednesday on Fox News Channels Tucker Carlson Tonight  host Tucker Carlson accused the left of using thousands of children that participated in a school walkout earlier in the day of exploiting those kids Carlson acknowledged a track record of the left exploiting children for political gain  and decried using children as a means to score a political advantage moral blackmail Transcript as follows If youve been watching TV today  you know that thousands of children walked out of school across America demanding the passage of new gun control laws  This followed the mass shooting in Parkland  FL  of course  The walkout is being hailed as an act of moral bravery  But  of course  students do not act independently  brave as they may be  They cant act independently  Theyre under control of adults  in this case by definition  theyre in school  When he heard a 16 year olds in school scream  Hey NRA  how many people did you kill today  you can guess about if they really know what theyre saying or if they really believe it  Some do  But you can be certain adults are behind it  and they are Todays events were organized by the womens march  supported by dozens of other groups  including Michael Bloombergs gun lobby  toPlanned Parenthood  Celebrities  journalists  political elites cheered them on  A TV channel Nickelodeon went dark for 17 minutes to show support for kids leading the way In New York City  a student die in was joined by the governor of the state  Andrew Cuomo  In Baltimore  that city spent more than  100 000 to transport students to anti gun rallies  This in a city with one of the highest murder rates in the nation  a city that cannot afford trash cans or streetlights Meanwhile  in Alexandria  VA  65 students walked out of an elementary school  as if kids under 10 can go anywhere by themselves  Now  whether you like the kids  like what theyre saying  and you may  but you should be opposed to this because kids should not be used to advance political agendas  anyones  Why  Because theyre children  Theyre not old enough to have the perspective adults do  Thats why we dont let them vote or a drink or  if the protesters have their way  buy guns Thats why its wrong to exploit them  which is exactly what is being done to them today  what the left is doing and has always done from Maos Red Guards to right now  The ANC in South Africa used kids as propaganda in the 80s  Their cause was morally defensible  Causes usually are morally defensible  But in the process  an entire generation of kids grew up to learn that activism is more important than learning and a lot of them regret it now  They were exploited  and there being exploited here  No matter what they chant  remember the enemy of the adults behind this isnt the NRA  Its anyone who opposes their broader agenda Thats people who have no power at all  So  the message is simple  stand against us  and youre against children  and therefore youre a monster  And if youre a monster  you deserve to be destroyed  Its a kind of moral blackmail Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter  jeff poor ,0
These results might seem like bad news to those in favor of arming qualified teachers and school personnel  but until now  the debate has been one sided  Eager to keep the hate directed at the NRA  our hysterical  anti gun media are quick to shut down this debate before it even begins Writing at the far left Washington Post  Greg Sargent vehemently opposes arming teachers  The suggestion that we arm teachers in response to school shootings is not just a profoundly  hideously awful idea  but he also worries the idea is picking up steam This is heavily driven by Republicans 68 percentof them support this  But so do a lot of independents  they are split  with 47 percent of them supporting the idea and 46 percent opposing it  he writes  emphasis original What should also worry the left is President Trumps persuasion skills  Unlike former President Obama  who proved incapable of selling anything outside of himself against two lackluster Republican presidential opponents  and despite a cacophony of opposition from Democrats and their media  Trump has moved the public opinion needle on a number of big issues  most especially  tax cuts and immigration  He is now in favor of arming qualified teachers In the wake of the Parkland  Florida  school shooting massacre  while the media have completely freaked out against the NRA  while the anti gun cable channel CNN has hosted hate driven town halls that attack motherhood and rape victims  Trump has been the calm in the storm  the adult in the room  the man leading our country to what he sees as actual solutions As a result  Trumps approval numbers have steadily risen to a point where he is now more popular than even Obama was at this point in his presidency  This means people are listening to Trump  responding to his leadership Moreover  because he is not a politician  Trump appears to actually be looking for real solutions to our countrys school shooting contagion  including modest gun control proposals  a ban on bump stocks and raising the legal age to 21 for the purchase of certain firearms  and arming qualified school personnel Like every sane person  Trump understands that no gun control law would have stopped a single one of these mass shootings  Bringing up gun control in the aftermath of one of these atrocities is nothing less than a red herring  nothing less than Democrats and the media exploiting a tragedy to push an agenda  and doing so at the expense of real solutions Not being a career politician  Trump wants to solve the problem  and the only way to do that is to end the suicidal madness of herding children into buildings where they are left completely helpless and defenseless  Worse  they are advertised as sitting ducks to every madman in the country Of course qualified armed personnel should be in every school building in America  just like you see armed personnel in every bank  major media outlet  movie studio  and government building in America  Talk about a no brainer Think about this  When a media outlet faces threats  it immediately armors up  increases security  And yet  when our children are massacred  these same media outlets stand in opposition to armoring up schools  This should tell you all you need to know about our medias craven agenda Teachers do not give up their Second Amendment civil rights once they become teachers Already in Texas  and without incident  qualified school personnel  including teachers  janitors  coaches  etc   are carrying concealed weapons  After heavy background checks and training  these staffers are designated as marshals and their identities kept secret  so they cannot be targeted This is common sense Even when local and federal government do not fail as catastrophically as we have seen in Parkland  by the time the police show up at a mass shooting  the murderer has already had time to kill dozens  Having someone on campus armed and trained is an absolute moral necessity Additionally  unlike a gun free zone  which promises mass murderers a building full of sitting ducks  just knowing they will immediately meet a good guy with gun will almost certainly serve as a deterrent At this stage of the debate  with Trump just getting warmed up in making his case  only 50 percent opposed to this common sense idea is a very good sign that this country might finally do the right thing and offer our children the same protections our media and Hollywood elite enjoy Follow John Nolte on Twitter  NolteNC  Follow his Facebook Page here ,0
I have officially announced the pro life walkout that i am organizing  It is going to take place on Wednesday  April 11th at 10 00 am  The walkout will last for 17 minutes  We encourage students across the country to participate in a stand for  life  Brandon Gillespie  bgillie13  March 22  2018 In an interview with Breitbart News  Brandon Gillespie  pictured  a student at Rocklin High School  said he met with his principal last Friday to discuss his plan for a pro life student walkout to protest abortion I asked him for the exact same accommodations that were given to the students who held the previous walkout on March 14  and he was not able to give me a direct answer on whether or not I was able to have this pro life walkout  Gillespie said  He told me he has to go talk to certain administrators and people in the school district before he can give me a direct answer  So  he told me he will be getting back to me on April 2 Gillespie notes  however  that while currently he cannot be certain his school will allow the pro life walkout  he does know the walkout is already slated to occur in schools throughout the country as a result of his social media campaign Initially I just started through social media  using the hashtag  Life  he explained  And the word has just spread  just through social media pretty much  through different media outlets and stuff  and just me going and doing interviews with people  People have been reaching out to me and saying  I love your cause  and I love what youre doing  and Im going to do this at my school Gillespie said his hope is to engage as many people as possible in the pro life movement Students participating in the pro life walkout on April 11 will walk out of their schools at 10 00 a m  in all time zones for 17 minutes  as did students who participated in the gun control walkout on March 14 On April 11th  students across the country are invited to participate in the  prolifewalkout  We are here to help with free resources and legal assistance Sign up today at https t co pa1FwHcTya  Students for Life  Students4LifeHQ  March 29  2018 Asked if he is primarily organizing the walkout because he is pro life or because he is challenging a potential double standard in public schools that allowed a student walkout during instructional time over promotion of a progressive issue such as gun control  Gillespie responded  Its a little bit of both So  yes  Im very pro life  Im against abortion  he continued  So  thats the biggest thing  But  also  I really want to test and see if there is a double standard at schools because the previous walkout on March 14 was school sanctioned and it was for gun control  So  I wanted to test the schools and see if they would allow a more conservative topic  Thats why Im doing this  but  yes  I am also very pro life Will you participate in the  ProLifeWalkout on Wednesday  April 11th  10 00am local time  pic twitter com CvEctdW314  Students for Life  Students4LifeHQ  March 29  2018 Gillespie said his history teacher  Julianne Benzel  was the main inspiration for his idea to launch the pro life walkout Shes the one who motivated me to do this because she questioned the school about whether it would give the same courtesy to a group of students that wanted to protest something else  for example  abortion  he explained  So  thats exactly what Im doing  Im testing to see if the school district will give the same courtesy  Shes really who inspired me to do this Benzel wasplacedon paid leave last week for questioning whether students against abortion would be permitted to walk out of class in the same way thousands of students walked out of class during instruction time on March 14 to promote gun control Complaints were made against Benzel by some parents and students who said her questions to her students were anti abortion  resulting in the teacher being placed on leave If schools  are going to allow one group of students to get up during class and walk out to protest one issue  would they still give the same courtesy to another group of students who wanted to get up and walk out to protest  sheasked  according to Fox News Insider  And I used the example of abortion Gillespie  who plans to enter the military after he completes high school  said he totally understands the criticism that no students should be permitted to engage in walkouts for political causes during instructional time But another big part of this is for students rights  he told Breitbart News  I dont think students understand that they still have their First Amendment rights  even when they are in school  Just because theyre in school  doesnt mean their rights are taken away  I want students to know across the country they still have the right to stand up for what they believe in  even if its conflicting with what the school district believes Connecticut based constitutional and education attorney Deborah Stevenson told Breitbart News the constitutional principles of equal protection under the law may apply in the case of the pro life walkout If one group was allowed to have a school walkout to advocate for school safety through gun control  then other groups may have a right to have a walkout to advocate for pro life causes  under the premise of equal protection principles  she said  This might be particularly true when both of the groups here are advocating for the protection of the lives of individuals Stevenson notes  however  that the use of taxpayer funds  under existing law  in many states  may preclude the kind of partisan political advocacy seen most recently by use of these walkouts However  if one side of an argument is allowed to effectuate that kind of demonstration  then it would appear to be fair to allow those who have an opposing point of view to do the same  she added  It would be wise  then  for all who seek to advocate using school district funds or services to determine their liability under the law before proceeding Though Gillespie said he believes  in general  students should not be out protesting for political causes during instructional time  he cannot dismiss the fact that schools allowed the gun control walkout Because schools sanctioned this first walkout  and that was taking place during class time  then they have to allow more  he asserted  So  until they come to a point at which they say  Okay  this is enough  No more protests during school time https t co 5hl3UZZS9J  Students for Life  Students4LifeHQ  March 23  2018 Asked if conservative students have a tougher time in public schools  Gillespie said living in California is definitely a challenge for him as a more conservative student I do believe it is harder for conservative students to speak their minds and say what they really think because most teachers are very left leaning politically  he explained Students for Life of America  SFLA   the nations largest organization of pro life youth  is serving as a resource for the Pro Life Walkout SFLA media specialist Kristi Hamrick told Breitbart News students can obtain information about their legal rights at ProLifeWalkout org  where students and schools can also sign up to participate in the walkout on April 11 We recognize that theres pushback  Hamrick said  We do have attorneys working with us  What was good for one cause is good for the other  So  in particular  if students are concerned about the legal issues associated with participating in the walkout  were going to help them with that The pro life walkout is student initiated and student driven  Hamrick added ,0
Tapper is being singled out for much of the criticism from those who say he remained silent as abusive personal attacks were hurled at Sen  Marco Rubio  R FL  and NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch  Incredibly  Tapper also remained silent as his audience booed a rape victim At the Wednesday night spectacle  those in favor of protecting our Second Amendment civil rights were vastly outnumbered by an audience packed with hostile gun haters and emotional questioners  including children According to various reports  the anti gun participants were given scripted questions crafted by CNN  The last place network has denied this by attacking a school shooting victim as a liar  His accusation  however  is credible given CNNs long and disturbing history of using plants Throughout the hour  the audience heckled  howled  and poured derision on Loesch and Rubio  Other than admonishing his audience for calling Loesch a murderer  Tapper stood by in silent approval as abuse and personal attacks rained down on his outnumbered guests The Media Research Center writes  Jake Tapper sat backas the wild crowd targeted  Rubio with boos and jeers The wildest moment allowed by Tapper was when Parkland  Florida student Cameron Kasky smeared the Senator by equating him to the shooter that killed 17 of his classmates  And Tapper thanked him for all of it Specifically  this is what Kasky snarled at Rubio  Senator Rubio  its hard to look at you and not look down the barrel on an AR 15 and not look at Nikolas Cruz Tapper then thanked Kasky Actor Adam Baldwin was one of many who compared the event to a show trial Jake Tapper is in danger of losing control of this show trial  Adam Baldwin  AdamBaldwin  February 22  2018 CPAC panel on the media calls last nights CNN town hall on guns a Trotskyite

debate by attacking her as a mother I wish I could have asked the NRA lady  Loesch  a question  Kasky said to Rubio  I would ask her how she can look in the mirror  considering the fact that she has children As the crowd burst into cheers  Tapper muttered something about What was that  Im sorry  The crowd roared on Absolutely despicable behavior by Parkland student Cameron Kasky  question ing

spread lies about Trump mocking a reporters disability  He also spread fake news with false claim that the president did not offer his condolences after a mosque shooting  While Tapper frequently attacks others over their tone and rhetoric  he does so while ginning up hatre against Trump by smearing the president as un American  unhinged  and unmoored Tapper has yet to apologize for his behavior or to the rape victim  he also has not disavowed Kaskys personal attacks or the behavior of the audience Follow John Nolte on Twitter  NolteNC  Follow his Facebook Page here ,0

He was semi retired  worked real estate on the side  coached lacrosse  ate right  went to the gym twice a day and spent part of the day training his dog and spent time with his kids I went from blessed to cursed  he says about the tragic day that his daughter Meadow  a high school senior  was murdered by a psychotic former student who walked into her school with a rifle  Now his life has changed forever  and Pollack is on a mission to make schools safer  but not by marching to demand more gun control Instead  Pollack went to work with Florida state legislatures  met with the Speaker of the House with simple messages  viz  Make our schools safer  Secure our children  His efforts ended in landmark legislation passing in Florida Im like a lion right now  I tell everyone  Ive got the heart of a lion since my daughter was murdered  Im been empowered to work 1 000 times harder on getting this done  he said in an interview with Breitbart News in Washington  DC Pollack traveled to Washington with his family to attend the March for Our Lives  spending the week meeting with Trumps cabinet members  Members of Congress  and political allies with the same message He felt hope after his message was well received in meetings across town  but when his son Hunter was denied a chance to speak at the march  he was frustrated I guess he didnt have the right agenda  I dont know  Im frustrated  he said  When my kid is frustrated  I get frustrated When it came time to march  he opted to coach his Lacrosse team instead after they also traveled to the nations capital to compete with area schools When I go out there  I escape from everything a little bit  Pollack said After the game  he told Breitbart News that he felt that the left had hijacked the student movement into an emotional tirade against guns   If somebody mentions the word gun control  the way I look is they are deflecting from keeping our schools safe  so it angers me  he said  Everyone has the right to march for whatever they want  but it takes away from our objective if youve got everybody shouting guns  and the schools are still wide open  You could walk in with a pistol  a rifle  a knife or an ax He blames the media for turning every mass shooting into a gun control issue rather than focusing on the simple task of making the schools more secure Thats all you hear now  When they start with the gun control  I take it personal  its not going to fix the schools  he said He chooses not to disparage the kids from Parkland  after they rallied at the March for Our Lives  but admits that he feels that the movement got hijacked This whole march was politicized  you know  but theyre kids  so you cant really blame them  theyre scared  they think theyre doing the right thing  he said Pollack was largely apolitical until the 2016 election where he voted for Trump together with his two sons It was the first time I ever voted  the 52 year old says about his vote for President Trump  Can you imagine where wed be if Hillary became president   He credits the president for standing up and running for office to fix the country  despite universal opposition from the media The guy gets bashed every hour of the day  he said  I dont know  I give him credit for doing it  hes 20 years older than me and he works like a maniac Pollack said the president showed interest in his message of hardening the schools after he and his sons visited with him at the White House I am deeply grateful for your presence at the White House for discussions regarding school safety  Trump wrote in a letter to the Pollack family after the meeting Hes also a gun owner and taught his children to shoot and handle firearms My daughter liked to shoot more than my sons  he says  recalling his time with Meadow But now his focus is entirely on school safety After watching legislative success in Florida  Pollack said he is founding a group called CLASS  Childrens Lives and School Safety He described it as an organization to represent children and parents across the country  demanding solutions to keep the schools more secure  He plans to travel state to state to campaign for similar legislative actions that were passed in Florida Despite the repeated shootings in schools  he noted  many of lawmakers and school administrators were still not making the practical changes to keep more kids safe   Theres no accountability to anybody  no accountability to the FBI  no accountability at the Sheriffs office  no accountability at the school board  so you know you see what this stuff keeps happening  he said Thats why he thinks parents need to have an organization to speak for them  just like unions represent the teachers and the police officers in political situations Im getting a lot of people interested  Im speaking for most Americans  thats what they want  not what the medias showing  he concludes To remember his daughter  he is raising money to build a magnificent playground athttps remembermeadow com This will not be any ordinary playground  this will be built for a princess  he said on his website where he is raising money for the project  Instead of visiting my princess at a graveyard  I will sit on a bench in her playground and watch other beautiful children play ,0
Sunday on CBSs Face the Nation  Andrew Pollack  who lost hisdaughter  Meadow at theParkland  FL school shooting last month  said changing gun laws was not achievable He said  however  that school safety was Partial transcript as follows ANDREW POLLACK  Well first I just want to tell everyone in America that is passionate about school safety like I am to follow me on remembermeadow com  and theyll be able to help me in my cause  What were going to do moving forward to help every other state  Move forward towards making their school safe so I could be the last dad that ever had to bury a kid killed in a school MARGARET BRENNAN  You have spoken passionately about this and Americans heard that cry when you spoke to the present directly on camera  You went back to talk about school safety this week  Do you have any pledges from the White House to follow through on some of what youre talking about with school safety ANDREW POLLACK  Well I went twice to the White House within the last two weeks  The president and every one of his staff was very compassionate  having my family in the White House  He  he  what could you say to a murdered kids father  You know  Theres not much anyones going to say thats going to make anything better for me  But he listened to things and suggestions that I had  and what were working on in Florida  and thats my agenda  what were going to move  Were going to move forward and fix these things  Im not looking at any other type of agenda right now And thats why I came here because its not really  I grew up when I grew up in Long Island  my father instilled in me  if you wanted something done right you do it yourself  So right now Im trying to do things my way and help  Im not listening  Im not leaving it up to the president  Im taking it in my hands and with a lot of people behind me  And were going to focus on school safety  and thats one of the reasons Im here today I have a message that Id like to get out MARGARET BRENNAN  And youre going and taking that message to Tallahassee Florida  I understand  this week ANDREW POLLACK  Yes  So one of the reasons why Im here is because theres been 200 shootings already in this country and theres a reason why it hasnt stopped because after every shooting  The media  they focus on gun control  OK  gun control thats a big problem  But I feel that if we all come together as parents  grandparents  uncles and we just work on this  Lets make our schools safe  All the marches that are going on that are going to have in D C  the kids  I understand the kids pain  My kid was murdered in that school  So if anyone understands that I understand every kid in that school how angry they are  But Im here now to talk to them  To say  lets focus on one thing first  Lets  lets get our schools safe  And then after every school is safe in the country that you could drop your kid off and you dont have to worry that some murderer is going to go kill your kid on the third floor  We could they could focus on any gun laws they want I dont  But first  lets come together we could march right through this country  Whos going to stop us  Who doesnt want our kids safe  Stay focused  Stay focused  OK  Im talking to you  Everyone out there you reach out to me  Lets stay focused  Reach out to me  reach out to my sons  who buried their little sister a couple of weeks ago  Let them march with you in D C  Lets get the right message across  Lets make these schools safe MARGARET BRENNAN  This week in your home state of Florida the state Senate rejected a proposal to ban assault weapons and supported the idea of arming teachers  Now some of the classmates of your daughter are among these activists ANDREW POLLACK  Yes MARGARET BRENNAN  One of them  Jacqueline Cornin  tweeted the Florida Senate has rejected the ban of AR 15s the weapon of choice used at my school to kill 17 souls  This breaks my heart  but we will NOT let this ruin our movement  This is for the kids  What do you think your daughter Meadow would be doing in the wake of something like this ANDREW POLLACK  Thats the problem  Again  theyre focusing on something thats not achievable  Gun laws right now are not achievable  My daughter was murdered by a gun  She should have been safe in the school  Thats the problem  So thats the first thing I want to address  Im not saying dont go after gun laws  Im not a

The Post went on to demonstrate that the figure of 18 arises from a Michael Bloomberg funded Everytown for Gun Safety tally that includes a suicide by a 31 year old man who parked in a school parking lot to kill himself Everytown also included a 1 a m   incident in which  a man was shot at a sorority event on the campus of Wake Forest University  an occasion on which someone shot several rounds in the air outside a Michigan high school basketball game  No one was in class at the time  the incident occurred at 8 p m   and no one was injured  but Everytown counted it anyway Our hearts are with all those impacted by the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland  Florida today This is the 18th school shooting in the U S  in 2018  https t co YdPLz4zuOS  Everytown  Everytown  February 14  2018 On February 14  Breitbart News fact checked Everytowns claims as well and found that eight of the 18 school shootings did not result in any injuries or fatalities  One of the shootings resulted when a gun was fired unintentionally and another resulted in a Louisiana high school student getting a superficial abrasion Leftists around the country began quoting the 18 school shootings in 2018 as soon as news broke of the February 14 attack on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School  One of the first was Sen  Kamala Harris  D CA  who tweeted Just awful  gut wrenching news  My heart breaks for the victims and families of the horrific shooting in Parkland  FL  This is the 18th school shooting in the first 43 days of 2018  We cannot accept this as normal  We must address gun violence  https t co QYrhLkKgi6  Kamala Harris  KamalaHarris  February 14  2018 Everytowns tally is wrong and Sen  Harriss tweet is wrong  The number of school shootings has been blown out of proportion and people are seizing on the exaggerated numbers  perhaps unknowingly  to push for more gun laws Ironically  in 2015 the Washington Post gave Everytown four Pinocchios for misleading methodology in a earlier set of gun control claims AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
Limbaugh pointed out that Democrats have spent two decades reacting to school shootings with calls for more gun control but have not offered one thing to make our schools safer  Instead  after a shooting occurs  he said the Democrats go political and they make tracks for the NRA  and for the gun lobby All the while  children largely remain in schools that are as wide open and unprotected as they were 20 years ago Limbaugh referenced the fact that an unarmed assistant football coach Aaron Feis  was killed in the February 14 Florida school shooting and asked listeners to consider how different things might have been if that coach had had a gun  Hesaid  Imagine if hed some ability to stop  the attack  without dying himself He went on to discuss other unarmed individuals who were shot and asked  Imagine if somebody in the school had had the means to fire back and stop this But Limbaugh observed that discussing the option of arming teachers  even for the purpose of saving lives  is not tolerated  He said  Let anyone suggest that we actually take steps inside these schools to be able to respond to these incidents when they happen and people say  You cant do that  you cant take guns in schools ' Limbaugh made similar comments during the February 18 airing of Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace  He told Wallacethat schools will not be safe until we get passed our aversion to making them safe from within  He said  We have armed security at virtually every public entity in this country  except schools  For some reason  they are a gun free zone and everybody that wants to shoot up a school knows that they are going to be the only one armed This scenario of vulnerability is perpetuated by the very Democrats who are so vocal against gun violence  Because of this  Limbaugh noted  school shootings will not end until we get serious about making a change AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
Trumps defense of the Second Amendment on January 28 was part of his overarching contention that sick people  rather than guns  are the problem The Daily Mail reportsthat Morgan indicated Paddock bought 55 guns legally in the year prior to the October shooting that killed 58 and wounded nearly 1 000 Trump responded  Well  we do have gun control laws and this sick person  he was a sicko  I mean thats the big problem  theyre sick people  If he didnt have a gun  he would have a bomb  or would have something else Morgan then criticized the number of guns Americans can legally buy  stressing again that Paddock purchased 55 Trump responded  The point is  he would have had 55 bombs  He would have had 55 of something else Trump then shifted to offense in the exchange  arguing that arming law abiding Americans for self defense outweighs passing more laws that would ultimately render law abiding Americans defenseless  He stressed again his believe that criminals and terrorists would think twice before attacking if they knew there would be bullets going in the opposite direction  In other words  attackers may find another target if they know their first choice is capable of shooting back Trump made similar pro Second Amendment arguments throughout his campaign for the presidency  For example  on January 10  2016  Trump highlighted the importance of an armed citizenry on Meet the Press afterreferencing the November 13  2015  Paris attack and the December 2  2105  San Bernardino attack If in Paris or if in California recently  where the fourteen people were killed and probably others to followin terms of that group because you have some people who are very  very badly woundedif in Paris they had guns or if in California  they had guns  on the other side  where the bullets go both ways  not just in one direction  You wouldnt have had the kind of carnage that you had AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

Following a moment of silence plus 13 seconds to honor the 13 people shot and killed at Columbine High School on April 20  1999  the group walked to the Capitol where speakers lashed out at Republicans and the National Rifle Association  NRA The organizers from schools in the D C  Virginia  and Maryland region collected letters demanding gun control from protesters addressed to legislators and registered voters via text But like the March for Our Lives protest last month and the first National School Walkout on March 14  the anti gun walkout protest is being pushed and funded by Michael Bloombergs Everytown for Gun Safety  which spawned the Students Demand Action group that participated on Friday Politico reported Looking to seize on activist outrage in the wake of the Florida school shooting  Everytown for Gun Safety  the group backed by former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg  is launching a five action plan to energize supporters ahead of the midterms The five points of the plan are  Pledge to vote on gun safety  research how much money local officials have accepted from the National Rifle Association  register friends to vote  force candidates to go on the record about gun policy through a provided candidate questionnaire  and urge people who are involved to run for office themselves Ian Berlin  17  a student at a D C  high school who told Breitbart News he organized the local protest  spoke from a small stage set up on the West Lawn of the Capitol Berlin said there are rules and regulations on the First Amendment  citing the permits the group needed to put on the protest And so too must we regulate the Second Amendment  Berlin said  Just as the freedoms of the First Amendment are subject to rules and regulation so too must be those protected under the Second No amendment is absolute  Berlin said  Your right to a gun does not supersede my right to graduate high school The teen noted that he was born shortly after the Columbine attack  and the government has taken no meaningful action to protect our schools and our communities from this epidemic of gun violence So to the politicians  I say youve had 19 years and now you have until November  Berlin said  If you dont act  we will vote you out Another teen  Micaela Lattimer  17  and a junior at Long Reach High School in Columbia  Maryland  said the anti gun movement must be intersectional  a decades old feminist social theory that asserts that people are often disadvantaged by multiple sources of oppression  their race  class  gender identity  sexual orientation  religion  and other identity markers Intersectionality recognizes that identity markers  e g  female and black  do not exist independently of each other  and that each informs the others  often creating a complex convergence of oppression Lattimer said that the people who died at Columbine and in Parkland  Florida  are not the only victims of gun violence I am here because when black activists have taken to the street to protest police shootings  members of law enforcement have responded in full riot gear and arrests  Lattimer said  citing statistics she claims show that black men and Latinos are at much higher risk of dying from being shot Lets keep this intersectional  Lattimer said The protesters also embraced the LGBT community and its link to gun violence  including suicide by a gunshot wound A teen from a high school in Rockville  Maryland  said she wanted to share her identity and then pointed out that queer youth are five times more likely to attempt suicide than their cisgender  heterosexual counterparts As Breitbart News reported  the National School Walkout was started by Lane Murdock  a 16 year old teen in Connecticut  after the Florida shootings But her efforts were also boosted by liberal adults  in Murdocks case  by the group Indivisible  which states on its website Our mission is to fuel a progressive grassroots network of local groups to resist the Trump Agenda  In every congressional district in the country  people like you are starting local groups and leading local actions  Are you standing indivisible with us  Then sign up for weekly actions and updates And Murdocks activism has evolved since she came up with the idea to walk out of school for 17 minutes to honor the dead in Florida  according to an interview she did with National Public Radio  NPR She wants people to know that shes imagining this day to be very different than the March For Our Lives or the 17 minutes of silence on March 14 in honor of the victims in Parkland  Fla  NPR reported  This walkout will last from 10 a m  through the end of the day People ask me  like  Why  Why all day  Murdock said Thats because this is a topic that deserves more than 17 minutes  NPR reported Follow Penny Starr on Twitter ,0
He was intimating that pro Second Amendment facts exist  but those facts are often dispelled by anti Second Amendment facts Of course  this is not how facts work  Instead  there is what is true and what is false  and facts distinguish the former from the latter For instance  Democrats rail against AR 15s and AK 47s as the weapon of choice for miscreants  but unvarnishedFBIstatsshow over four times more people were stabbed to death in 2016 than were shot and killed with rifles of any kind Democrats contend that gun control makes us safer  but Colorado adopted universal background checks  a high capacity magazine ban  and other gun controls in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School attack only to witness two high profile shootings in 2015 andten officers shot since December 31  2017 Moreover  gun control proponents like Piers Morgan rage against the number of guns Americans can legally buy  implying that more guns equal more crime  But a Congressional Research Service report shows that as private gun ownership expanded from 192 million firearms in 1994 to 310 million firearms in 2009  crime fell sharply According to the report  the firearm related murder and non negligent homicide rate was 6 6 per 100 000 Americans in 1993  Following the exponential growth in the number of guns  that rate fell to 3 6 per 100 000 in 2000 There are not alternative facts in play  Rather  there are facts versus claims that cannot be bolstered The same is true for concealed carry reciprocity  Concealed permit holders are among the most law abiding of law abiding citizens  On May 27  2017 Breitbart Newsreported aCrime Prevention Research Center studyshowing that from January 1  2005  through December 31  2007  the yearly rate of misdemeanors and felonies by full time police officers was  102percent  On the other hand  the yearly rate for Texass concealed carry permit holders in the year 2015   the year campus carry was signed into law in that statewas  0102 percent Again  these are just facts So when national reciprocity is pushed as a way to help the common man defend himself  with claims that guns in the hands of law abiding citizens in more places will reduce crime  the onus is on the opposing side  And the victory goes to the side with the facts  not to the bearer of alternative facts  whatever they are AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

The era of the assault weapons ban is often presented as the good ol days for Democrats  The years were 1994 2004  the early part of which occurred when a Democrat run Congress could pass gun control with the assurance that President Bill Clinton  D  would sign it into law  And just hours after the heinous attack on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School  various Democrats  including Sen  Dianne Feinstein  pushed to bring back the assault weapons ban once more On February 15 the push was joined by Washington Post reporter Christopher Ingraham  who writes that easy to obtain assault weapons   were once banned under U S  law  And he quoted University of Massachusetts professor Louis Klaveras to assure us that we would see drastic reductions in  gun massacres if the ban were put back in place Later in the article  after stressing that the assault weapons ban covered high capacity magazines too  Ingraham wrote  Thekillers in recent incidents likeLas Vegas OrlandoandSutherland Springswere each able to walk into a gun shop in the days and months before their attacks  and legally purchase their assaultweapons and magazines after passing a standard background check  Under an assault weapons ban  that wouldnt be possible What Ingraham overlooks is the fact that it was 100 percent legal to buy an AR 15 and a high capacity magazine during the assault weapons ban  the only difference between buying pre and post ban was the price For example  even though high capacity magazines were banned  the ban did not impact high capacity magazines that were already in circulation  Therefore  the ban only served to limit the supply  thereby magnifying the demand and driving up the price As for AR 15s  you could still buy one  it simply could not have a flash hider  a collapsible stock  a thumbhole stock  and numerous other cosmetic features and or accessories  Therefore  a Bushmaster AR 15 sold during the assault weapons ban is bulkier than the Bushmaster sold today  but it is nonetheless an AR 15  And it shipped with a 10 round magazine  versus a 30 round one  but that deficiency could be defeated by buying a 30 round one that was already in circulation or by taping two 10 round magazines together for quick and easy switch out In other words  the Democrats gun control glory days were not that glorious AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

Yet today  due to the breakdown in education wrought by leftist academicians and media talking heads  many Americans presume a well regulated militia and shall not be infringed are polar opposites  that the former represents a collective right viewpoint while the latter presents the right as an individual one  Such presumptions create a false dichotomy that pits one phrase against another in an amendment where both phrases were meant to be of mutual benefit Consider the Second Amendment  A well regulated militia  being necessary to the security of a free state  the right of the people to keep and bear arms  shall not be infringed At the outset we must understand that the individual right to keep and bear arms is not in spite of the mention of a militia but because of it  In other words  because the militia played a key role in the Founders minds  and is intended to play a key role even now  the right to possess arms  with which to gather in militia  shall not be infringed Think about what is conveyed by the term militia  In the majority opinion for District of Columbia v Heller  2008  Justice Antonin Scalia explained Unlike armies and navies  which Congress is given the power to create  to raise       Armies  to provide       a Navy  Art  I  8  cls  1213  the militia is assumed by Article I already to be in existence  Congress is given the power to provide for calling forth the militia  8  cl  15  and the power not to create  but to organiz e  itand not to organize a militia  which is what one would expect if the militia were to be a federal creation  but to organize the militia  connoting a body already in existence  ibid  cl  16  This is fully consistent with the ordinary definition of the militia as all able bodied men  From that pool  Congress has plenary power to organize the units that will make up an effective fighting force Add to this the insights of Founding Father James Madison  who used Federalist 46 to explain that the American citizenry had within itself the authority to band together for purposes of repelling tyranny  He clearly stated that ultimate authorityresides in the people alone  And he explained that even a federal government fitted with a standing army will find itself unable to overcome the people  armed and banded together  Extravagant as the supposition is  let it however be made  Let a regular army  fully equal to the resources of the country  be formed  and let it be entirely at the devotion of the federal government  still it would not be going too far to say  that the State governments  with the people on their side  would be able to repel the danger Individuals who wish to dismiss Madisons contention that we own arms for the purposes of repelling tyranny often suggest that Madisons position is not realistic  that our standing army is too great to be withstood by average Americans  But those who say such things fail to understand how many average Americans own guns  and because of this  how deep the militia roster reaches Madison put it thus The highest number to which  according to the best computation  a standing army can be carried in any country  does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole number of souls  or one twenty fifth part of the number able to bear arms  This proportion would not yield  in the United States  an army of more than twenty five or thirty thousand men  To these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands  officered by men chosen from among themselves  fighting for their common liberties  and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence  It may well be doubted  whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops  Those who are best acquainted with the last successful resistance of this country Again  the emphasis on militia and repelling tyranny is not meant to incite offensive action but to assure a tyrannical government that average  armed Americans are capable of coming together to stop the encroachments upon liberty  But take away firearms or heavily restrict them via gun control and the militia is de fanged  becoming nothing more than a group of men bound together with weapons consisting of stones  sticks  and verbal jabs Therefore  because a well regulated militia is necessary to

Theres really a handful of marches that you remember  That our town remembers  Todd said on Sundays Meet the Press  The civil rights marches of the 60s  the abortion rights marches of the 80s and 90s  Tea party  Million Man March  I think about those things  This is right up there Legacy media reporters  many of whom yearn to be like the reporters during the civil rights era in the 1960s  gushed over the gun control event  comparing it to the Vietnam War protests  the environmental movement  and the civil rights marches NBC Nightly News over the weekend also compared Saturdays march to the civil rights movement in a piece about the faces of idealism March for Our Lives organizers even brought Martin Luther Kings granddaughter on stage on Saturday to hammer home the desired connection My grandfather had a dream that his four little children will not be judged by the color of their skin  but by the content of their character I have a dream that enough is enough  Yolanda King told the crowd  And that this should be a gun free world  period ,0
He first broached the subject after theOctober 1  2015  attack on Umpqua Community College  UCC  an attack in which an armed man entered a gun free campus and killed nine people  Trump responded to the attack by saying  Ill tell you  if you had a couple of the teachers or someone with guns in that room  you would have been a hell of a lot better off Weeks later  during the October 28  2015  presidential debate  Trump revisited the topic by stressing that gun free zones actually attract attackers who might avoid campus if they knew their would be victims could shoot back  He said gun free zones provide target practice for sickos Two months later  on October 8  2016 The Washington Postquoted Trump saying  I will get rid of gun free zones on schools The left went apoplectic over the suggestion that teachers should be armed to defend their lives and the lives of their children  Sen  Chris Murphy  C CT  called the idea sinister and said Trump was only suggesting it because it was part of doing the bidding of the gun lobby  These are strange words when one considers that Murphy is a Senator from a state where 26 innocents were gunned down in a gun free zone  Sandy Hook  a zone where the law abiding teachers and staff were prohibited from having guns with which to shoot back if under attack Of course  Hillary Clinton recoiled at Trumps idea of allowing teachers to carry guns for self defense  After all her lamentations over school shootings and attacks on innocents in other gun free zones TIME quoted her saying that arming teachers  is  no way to keep us safe For leftists like Sen  Murphy and Hillary Clinton  the solution is always more gun control  which means more the very laws that are failing to stop attackers now  In rare cases a leftist will even voice support for more armed school resource officers  but Marjory Stoneman Douglas High had an armed officer on campus at the time of the attack and the shooter simply circumvented him  And once the shooter avoided detection by that lone officer he could be confident that no one else could offer armed resistance Is this the lefts way to keep us safe  If it is  it is not working There must be layers of defense  as Police Ones Mike Wood explains  that those layers include an exterior  comprised of armed resource officers  and an interior  comprised of teachers  and staff  who have concealed carry licenses and have met their states training standard to carry in school  Without the latter  attackers who are sly enough to make it onto campus are literally unstoppable It was difficult to argue against Trumps assessment that some of the teachers at Umpqua Community College should have been armed and it is even harder to argue with it now He campaigned on removing the prohibitions against teachers being armed for self defense  We are waiting for the fulfillment of that promise It is inhumane to demand that educators likewise be sitting ducks AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
According to theDaily Mail  Trump said  When we declare our schools to be gun free zones it just puts our students in far more danger  His statement comes justover a week after Nikolas Cruz carried a rifle into a gun free zone and opened fire  killing 17 Trump said  Well trained  gun adept teachers and coaches and people who work in those buildings should be allowed to carry guns to quickly end such attacks in the future Trump pledgedduring the 2016 presidential campaign to get rid of gun free school zones  More than once  he indicated that teachersshould be armed to shoot back at attackers and defend childrens lives On February 21  Trump began a steady push for armed teachers as part of his response to the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School attack  Sen  Richard Blumenthal  D CT  described the effort as absolutely abhorrent  According to the Hill  Blumenthal also described arming teachers as an anathema But Trump assured the CPAC audience that his push to arm teachers is based on teachers love for their students  because they love them  they will also protect them  Trump said   Teachers love their students  They dont want their students to be killed and to be hurt  He described teachers as patriots who could become schools first line of defense against crazed attackers During his CPAC speech  Trump again mentioned a focus on background checks and mental illness  but he made no mention of raising the minimum purchase age for long rifles He did take timeto point out that Democrats will take your Second Amendment if given control of Congress AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

Their plan for defending children by securing school campuses is now summed up on one succinct planNational School Shield On December 21  2012  one week after the attack on Sandy Hook  NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre said We care about the President  so we protect him with armed Secret Service agents Yet when it comes to the most beloved  innocent and vulnerable members of the American family  our children  we as a society leave them utterly helpless  and the monsters and predators of this world know it and exploit it  That must change now Theyre our kids  Theyre our responsibility  And its not just our duty to protect them  its our right to protect them What if  when Adam Lanza started shooting his way into Sandy Hook Elementary  he had been confronted by qualified  armed security Will you at least admit the possibility that 26 innocent lives might have been spared  Is that so abhorrent to you that you would rather continue to risk the alternative How many more copycats are waiting in the wings for their moment of fame The NRA is going to bring all of its knowledge  dedication and resources to develop a model National School Shield Emergency Response Program for every school that wants this   This will include  armed securityand teacher training The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun More recently  during the February 16 airing of NRATVs Grant Stinchfeld  NRA chief of staff Josh Powell noted that we protect celebrities  pro athletes  and the political class with guns  yet leave our children vulnerable to attack Powellsaid Its time we get serious  We need to get very serious about how were going to protect our kids  the measures that need to be put in place  The awful irony of this is when you look at athletes  celebrities  the political class  all of these people have security  and many of them have armed security  So the question is at what point are we going to get serious enough about protecting our children and give the protections that all these other groups get There have been few changes since Sandy Hook Elementary  The left has called for gun control after gun control yet  by and large  our schools remain insecure and our children remain at risk  The attack on gun free Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School was a blaring reminder of this  They had an armed resource officer  but on a campus of over 3 000 students  one officer is hard pressed to locate and stop a determined killer who is cunning enough to acquire his gun via compliance with all the lefts gun controls Enter the NRAsNational School Shield  a layered approach to safety to help ensure a predator who violates the outside of the perimeter of a campus can be stopped  even eliminated  before students are harmed School Shield requires training  installation  and acquaintance with certain communications equipment  surveillance methods  protocols  and security  The end result is a greater assurance that children can be protected and campuses spared should an attacker attempt to strike All these things cost money  so the NRA is providing grants to guarantee that schools in the poorest economic areas can protect their children on par with schools in the wealthiest economic areas By securing schools  the NRA does more than keep buildings and classrooms safe  they actually keep our childrenand teachers safe too And safe is a comforting word in a world full of evil men seeking a weak point at which to strike AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
The FBIs lukewarm response to multiple tips that Nikolas Cruz  the suspect in the Parkland  FL  school massacre that left 17 people dead  was a potential threat  came under fire from both sides of the political spectrum almost immediately House asked Cassidy if he would support Congress looking into the oversights that left Cruz able to carry out his attack despite the FBI receiving tips in both September and January that the19 year old was contemplating violence  the police reportedly having been called to his home 39 times  and his threatening both online and in person to bring guns to school Absolutely  Cassidy replied  Here we have the FBI  not with subtle findings  but with horrible findings of a young man who the police have been called on 39 different occasions  posting YouTube videos  Someone within a month or even sooner reporting to the FBI that he was prone to danger  fellow students at the school identifying him as someone who was incredibly troubled  and it wasnt followed up on  Why not  And how systemic is that issue I think thats something Congress should be interested in  he continued On Friday  the day before Cassidys radio appearance  Florida Gov  Rick Scott called for FBI Director Christopher Wray to resign over the fiasco  when asked for his opinion  Cassidy was reluctant to do the same The FBI director has not been on the job that long  but someone should be held accountable  Cassidy said  If theres a training accident and a Navy sailor dies  it isnt the head of the Navy who steps down  it is the  Admiral most directly in charge steps down  And whoevers most directly in charge should be held accountable Cassidy was also skeptical of the cascade of generic calls for gun control in response to the Parkland shooting  Im never quite sure what people mean by gun control  he told House  If they mean making sure that the mentally ill or those prone to danger dont get weapons  absolutely  Thats already the law  we need to implement it  If they mean the confiscation of weapons from law abiding citizens  that is another issue Other topics discussed include the senators continued effort to completely repeal and replace Obamacare  the Republican tax cut  immigration  and the 2018 midterm elections Breitbart News Saturdayis broadcast live on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 from 10 00 a m   1 00 p m  Eastern The full interview can be heard below LISTEN ,0

The piece of legislation in view is the National Firearms Act  1934  It was technically put in place a year after prohibition ended  but it was crafted in response to the 1929 Valentines Day Massacre  which resulted from tensions betweenAl Capone and Bugs Moran The Sun Times observes The original National Firearms Act imposed a tax on the making and transfer of certain firearms  as well as a special  occupational  tax on persons and entities engaged in the business of importing  manufacturing  and dealing in NFA firearms  The law also required the registration of all NFA firearms with the secretary of the Treasury  Firearms subject to the 1934 act included shotguns and rifles having barrels less than 18 inches in length  certain firearms described as any other weapons  machineguns  and firearm mufflers and silencers The Sun Times describes NFA as surprisingly effective and non controversial  They note that in 1986  Congress strengthened the NFA definition of silencer by adding combinations of parts for silencers and any part intended for use in the assembly or fabrication of a silencer They then use the NFA as a blueprint for other gun controls that are currently being pushed  especially gun controls relating to school shootings  The problem with this suggestion is that it overlooks the fact that the NFA has not prevented mass public attacks from occurring  Moreover  it has not prevented school shootings from taking place either In fact  if the prevention of such attacks is the measurement  the NFA has failed in every way  except for where it relates to giving money to the government via the federal tax on NFA regulated items Think about itHow many firearm based mass public attacks have occurred since NFA was passed in 1934  How many attacks have occurred on schools  Here is a short list of mass public attacks and school attacks during the last 19 years Seven individuals were killed in the 1929 Valentines Day Massacre  Many times that number have been killed in the numerous attacks which the NFA has been powerless to prevent Thirteen were killed at Columbine  32 were killed Virginia Tech  12 were killed in the Aurora movie theater  nine were killed at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal  nine were killed at Umpqua Community College  14 were killed in San Benardino  49 were killed in Orlando  26 were killed in the Texas church  and the list goes on If NFA proved impotent to stop these attackswhich only represent attacks during the last 19 yearshow can it be held up as a gun control to emulate going forward AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0

Israel  with its long and painful history of contending with terrorism  is rich with examples that prove this contention  In recent years  armed citizens have stopped dozens of terrorists  In some cases  those citizens acted when cowardly police officers shrank from danger For instance  on March 6  2008  a terrorist disguised as a delivery man entered the Merkaz Harav seminary in Jerusalem with an assault rifle hidden in a television box  He opened fire on students studying in the library Two beat cops arrived on the scene but failed to enter the building to stop the killing In the event  a seminary student armed with a handgun  and an off duty infantry officer who lived in the neighborhood  heard the shots and ran to the seminary  The student  a young rabbi  was armed with a handgun  the officer was carrying his assault rifle  Both men ignored the police officers who told them not to go inside  They entered the building and killed the terrorist  ending the massacre  By the time they arrived  eight students  including five high school students  had been killed  while eight more were wounded The most recent Palestinian terror campaign  which lasted more or less from October 2015 through April 2016  showed the need for an armed citizenry  In two major attacks in Tel Aviv  the terrorists  armed with rifles were able to kill at will for several minutes because none of the civilians at the sites of the attacks were armed In contrast  terror attacks in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria  which took place during the same period  were repeatedly stopped at their outset by armed civilians who ran to the scene within moments In response to the public outcry  Public Security Minister Glad Erdan slightly loosened restrictions on eligibility for gun licenses and encouraged citizens with gun licenses to carry their weapons wherever they go Erdans move to loosen restrictions on eligibility for gun permits shone a light on an aspect of Israeli life of which foreigners are largely unaware The widespread conception in the U S  in particular is that Israeli gun laws are liberal  This is incorrect  Israel has strict gun laws  But at the same time  it has mandatory conscription in the military Active duty combat soldiers on leave are often required to take their weapons home with them  Soldiers who do not own gun safes large enough to store their assault rifles are required to take them everywhere they go  As a result  tourists often happily snap pictures of young Israelis carrying assault rifles at restaurants and nightclubs Israels gun laws are the nightmare of Second Amendment champions  To be eligible for a gun license in Israel you must be 21 years old and a military veteran  or 27 years old Only people who meet specific criteria are eligible to apply for gun permits  Israelis who live or work in communities defined as at risk from a national security perspective by the government can apply for gun licenses  Farmers  tour guides  and people who transport hazardous materials are permitted to carry a gun  Military officers and NCOs on active duty may carry a personal handgun  Veterans of special forces units and other elite security services are permitted to carry a gun  Retired senior officers are entitled to carry a gun To receive a weapons permit  you must first undergo weapons training at a certified training facility and receive a health certification from a licensed physician If you are healthy and are eligible  you may receive a gun permit  That permit enables you to own and carry one handgun and fifty bullets Shotgun and rifle ownership is limited to veterinarians  nature preserve employees  and licensed hunters  These weapons may only be used for animal control However  whereas in the U S  most states do not permit armed citizens to walk around with their weapons exposed  Israel has no such restrictions on its gun owners  Gun owners may carry their weapons openly or in a concealed manner  whichever they prefer Whereas private ownership of firearms is constrained  public use of firearms is more widespread  Every school in Israel is guarded by an armed security guard  Everyone entering a school has to pass through a manned  secure entrance Armed guards escort all school trips everywhere in the country Armed guards and metal detectors are stationed at the entrance to every underground parking lot  every supermarket  every hospital  every shopping mall  and every hotel in Israel All major public events need to be approved by the police  The organizers need to secure the perimeter of their events in coordination with the police  As a result  most of the mass shooting attacks that happened in the U S  and Europe in recent years would have been much more difficult to carry out in Israel  For instance  the truck ramming attack on Bastille Day in Nice in 2016  in which an Islamic State terrorist killed 86 and wounded 458  would not have been possible in Israel In Israel  police would have cordoned off the entire area where the event took place  No trucks would have been permitted to enter the perimeter and likely no unauthorized vehicles would have been permitted to enter the perimeter  Moreover  security guards and metal detectors would have been deployed at all entry points to the event The massacre outside the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino in Las Vegas last year would also have been more difficult  if not impossible  to have carried out in Israel A security officer at the entrance to the hotel would have stopped the shooter from bringing his weapons and ammunition into the building If the killer had managed to smuggle his weapons into the hotel  and had begun shooting  it would have taken hotel security officers very little time to identify the source of the fire  enter his room  and stop him Israel bars gun ownership from mentally ill individuals  While there are a lot of illegal weapons in Israel  particularly in the Arab community  there is no legal way for someone who is mentally ill to acquire a weapon lawfully Despite the vast differences regarding the private ownership of weapons  there are two lessons from Israels experience that may be significant for Americans searching for ways to stop mass shootings The first lesson that Israel can offer relates to tactics for minimizing the risk of attack  Americans can learn from the Israeli model of controlling entry and exit points from schools and other public facilities  from Israels ban on guns to the mentally ill  and from its unapologetic policy of profiling terror suspects The second lesson from Israels experience that bravery is a vital social virtue Like millions of Americans  Israelis are brave  Because they are brave  they stand up to terrorists  When they have guns  they stand up to terrorists with guns  When they lack guns  they stand up to terrorists with whatever they have In February 2017  a group of citizens outside a sewing machine repair shop in Petah Tikva in central Israel stopped a terrorist who had been shooting and stabbing bus passengers by throwing sewing machines at him In January 2016  a mom and pop grocery store owner in a small town in Judea blocked two knife wielding terrorists from entering his store by pushing them out with a shopping cart A society that values bravery can rely on its citizens to be brave more easily than a society that values victimhood Israels restrictive gun laws are a function of many aspects of Israeli society that are very different from conditions in America  including its powerful central government  its socialist roots  and its large Arab community Israels tragic history with terror attacks has required Israel to learn how to secure all public spaces and deploy forces to major civilian thoroughfares  And it has also taught Israelis to be brave ,0

The Daily Mail reports that Google searches for NRA membership rose 4 900 percent since the Florida attack  That rise occurred at a time when many Democrats  media personalities  and Hollywood celebrities were denouncing the NRA as causal in the shooting that took 17 lives in a gun free zone The Hollywood attitude was epitomized by writer director Judd Apatow  actress Mia Farrow  and comedian Chelsea Handler  all of whom responded to the Florida school attack by calling out the NRA to drive a wedge between voters and pro gun legislators For example  Handler tweeted We have to elect candidates that are not funded by the NRA in November  We have an opportunity to elect candidates who wont allow kids to go to school and get shot  It is disgusting how many times this has happened and Republicans do nothing  You all have blood on your hands  Chelsea Handler  chelseahandler  February 14  2018 CNNs February 21 gun control town hall highlighted the medias animosity towards the NRA  as it featured survivors from the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting confronting Republicans over NRA affiliation  The Guardian reported that one student spoke to Sen  Marco Rubio  R FL  asking Can you tell me right now you will not accept a single donation from theNRA In addition  more than a dozen companies severed ties with the NRA in the wake of the school attack  ending discounted rates and fares for NRA members But a large swath of the American populace is equating these various attacks on the NRA with attacks on the Second Amendment  and others see the attacks as proof of media bias  The result is an explosion in NRA memberships The Daily Mail quoted Cleta Mitchell  a former NRA board member and former Oklahoma lawmaker  who said  There is no one  NO ONE  Who joins the NRA for a discount on a rental car  You can rest assured that the NRA will not lose a single member as a result of this  If anything  it should spur people to join the NRA as a means of demonstrating that we who believe in the Second Amendment will not be bullied by these left wing multi billion dollar corporations AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
In other words  he has effectively ignored it for over a year National reciprocity was introduced in the House on January 3  2017  It passed 48 weeks later on December 6  after conservatives rallied to overcome Speaker Paul Ryans  R WI  stonewalling of the measure  But the push for national recognition of concealed carry permits remains stalled in the Senate The left opposes national reciprocity and uses a relentless disinformation campaign to prevent passage of it For example  Gabby Giffords gun control group suggests that national reciprocity would  create  a dangerous threat to public safety by forcing states with strong concealed carry laws to honor permits from states with weak or non existent concealed carry laws  And the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence describes national reciprocity as arm anyone legislation In reality  national reciprocity deals with concealed carry permit holders who must currently navigate a cumbersome patchwork of concealed carry laws in order to keep a gun on their persons for self defense  It corrects the cumbersome patchwork by replacing it with federal recognition of concealed permits  honoring such permits nationwide in a manner similar to drivers licenses And because concealed carry permit holders are among the most law abiding of law abiding citizens  the benefits of having them armed extend far beyond the safety of the concealed carrier himself President Trump voiced support for national reciprocity on the campaign trail and the House has already passed national reciprocity legislation  Now the common man waits for McConnell to act for national reciprocity and make self defense a nationwide reality To date  McConnell has allowed the Senates national reciprocity legislation to languish for over a year AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
On Thursday afternoon  Sen  Ted Cruz  R TX  spoke to the far left CNN for 15 minutes about the Parkland school shooting massacre and his specific ideas about preventing future massacres  Nevertheless  hours after Cruz recorded that interview  CNN anti Trump pundit Chris Cuomo publicly taunted Cruz as a coward for not talking to CNN If Cruz thinks gun control improvement is not the answer  what is  the left wing Cuomo tweeted hours after Cruz recorded the interview  Ask the question  Senator  what are we going to do to stop school shootings  Dont just say what wont work  work to find an answer Linked to Cuomos frantic and confusing tweet was a Hill article reporting on Cuomos bullying of Cruz earlier that same day  Chris Cuomo names GOP lawmakers on air who wouldnt come on CNN after

having none of it  On Friday  using his own Twitter account  the Texas senator linked Cuomos fake news taunt and wrote  Thats funny  I spoke to CNN for 15 mins yesterday about proactive solutions to prevent gun violence  yet CNN has aired NONE of it  Why not air the  entire  interview As proof  Cruz included a picture taken of him during the interview  along with this comment  Heres a pic of the  CNN interview  a 15 min exclusive given yesterday  that yall still havent aired  While falsely claiming Im afraid to talk to CNN Here's a pic of the  CNN interview  a 15 min exclusive given yesterday

attempted to move the goalposts Cruz and others were invited to come on  my show New Day  and be tested about how to stop these shootings  They declined  Cuomo explained  If Cruz or others did an intv

ChrisCuomo  February 16  2018 Cuomos neurotic response can only be interpreted as trashing his own network for not testing Cruz in the way Cuomo believes he personally would have tested Cruz  One wonders if Cuomo would have made that insulting insinuation if the CNN reporter interviewing Cruz was a man instead of a woman But it was not just Cuomo taunting Cruz  The pro North Korea CNN itself joined the bullying with this on air graphic that was later dropped on social media by CNN anti Trump pundit Brian Stelter What are they afraid of  CNN calling out  FLGovScott   TedCruz   MarcoRubio for avoiding interviews pic twitter com cizvTyU5XP  Brian Stelter  brianstelter  February 15  2018 Even more troubling is the fact that the CNN graphic and Cuomos claim that Cruz chickened out on a New Day appearance appears to also be fake news  According to Cruz staffer Catherine Frazier  what CNN  Cuomo  and Stelter are covering up is the fact that Cruz was not even asked to appear on New Day until 8 11 a m  49 minutes before the last place show ended Pardon my typo  49 minutes  Catherine Frazier  catblackfrazier  February 15  2018 By asking Cruz to come on at the last possible second  and when you consider CNNs history of using proven lies and extremist rhetoric to gin up hate against Republicans  it is not unfair to wonder if CNN deliberately tried to set Cruz up to attack him with the fake news the he is a coward for not coming on Why else would CNN hide the Cruz interview and allow these attacks to continue even after Cruz had already done the interview CNNs sitting on the Cruz interview while taunting Cruz for not doing an interview is nothing less than a partisan dirty trick The pro gun control Cuomo  who is widely viewed as not very bright  and who is sometimes mocked with the nickname Fredo  is also attacking those he derisively refers to as the thoughts and prayers crowd Look what these guys are focused on   The thoughts and prayers crowd  Patriots  https t co hgXxST9u2h  Christopher C  Cuomo  ChrisCuomo  February 15  2018 Cuomo even retweeted someone quoting him  Cuomo  as saying on air  What kind of prayer is one that promises to do nothing Cuomo identifies as a Catholic  How  then  he can see the act of praying as doing nothing  he has yet to explain Cuomos shrill and shameless grandstanding might have something to do with New Days humiliating ratings  Total Average Viewers  New Day 565 000 Morning Joe 1 095 million Fox and Friends 1 501 million In all of cable on Tuesday  New Days best showing was during its 9 a m  ET hour  Nevertheless  only 669 000 people tuned in  and the hour ranked 95th By comparison  on MSNBC  Morning Joes earliest hour  6 a m  ET  snagged 1 095 million viewers and ranked 86th Fox  Friends ranked 54th and attracted a whopping 1 826 million viewers at 9 a m   nearly tripling the faltering Cuomo CNN itself is in major ratings trouble  The anti Trump cable channel lost a whopping  30 percent of its primetime viewers and has fallen way behind MSNBC and Fox News It would appear as though the only thing politicians need be afraid of when it comes to appearing on CNN is 1  not being seen at all and 2  being sandbagged by CNNs abiding affection for spreading fake news Follow John Nolte on Twitter  NolteNC  Follow his Facebook Page here ,0
The announcement came just hours after CNN published a story  Advertisers flee InfoWars founder Alex Jones YouTube channel  in which journalistsPaul P  Murphy and Gianluca Mezzofiore approached companies to explain why their ads were showing up on Alex Joness channel Murphy and Mezzofiore also asked YouTube why it had not filtered out certain advertisers from showing up on the channel due to its offensive content The CNN article reads less like coverage of news and more like a chronicle of an activist campaign to damage Joness channel  Many of the brands  including Nike  Moen  Expedia  Acer  ClassPass  Honey  Alibaba and OneFamily  have suspended ads on InfoWars channels after being contacted by CNN for comment  the authors noted On Saturday evening  Jones tweeted The Alex Jones channel with billions of views is frozen  We have been told it will be deleted tomorrow and all 33 thousands videos will be erased The Alex Jones channel with billions of views is frozen  We have been told it will be deleted tomorrow and all 33 thousands videos will be erased  We just set up this new page subscribe if you want to see what the SPLC wants censored  https t co 0sGkMNUCPt  Alex Jones  RealAlexJones  March 4  2018 UPDATE Per CNNs Oliver Darcy  YouTube has denied telling Jones his channel will be deleted Jones referred to the Southern Poverty Law Center  SPLC  a left wing group whose overly broad lists of hate groups have provoked criticism by conservatives  and have led to innocent people being targeted  literally   The domestic terrorist who tried to carry out a mass shooting at the offices of the Family Research Council in 2012told interrogators that he had targeted the organization after he read that it was anti gay at the SPLC website The SPLC mentioned Jones in a Feb  23 article attacking some right wing outlets for spreading a conspiracy theory that some of the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who had appeared in numerous television interviews since the Feb  14 mass shooting in Parkland  Florida  were actors coached to deliver anti gun messages  The SPLC also describes Jones as almost certainly the most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary America CNN reported on Feb  24 that YouTube had punished the Alex Jones Channel for a video titled  David Hogg Cant Remember His Lines In TV Interview  Hogg  a student at the high school  has been among the most strident gun control activists in the days since the shooting  vowing not to return to school until new gun control laws were passed  and accusing National Rifle Association spokeswoman Dana Loesch  a mother of two  of not caring about children In response  InfoWars published an article accusing CNN of conducting a campaign to ban conservative media  The author  Paul Joseph Watson  defended the Alex Jones Channels video  The videos in question did not claim the school shooting didnt happen or that the victims were actors  as CNN has falsely misrepresented  The videos questioned if some of the prominent students who are now publicly leading a nationwide campaign for gun control were being coached on what to say Watson continued  The ability to question the statements of public figures on television is part of basic free expression under the First Amendment  and does not constitute bullying or harassment  as YouTube claims CNN once seemed to agree  Brian Stelter  host of CNNs media analysis show Reliable Sources  wrote an op ed in November  Whose freedom is it  arguing that the First Amendment did not just protect citizens against government censorship  but was also relevant to users of social media networks Stelter argued Press freedom is YOUR freedom  Thats the way I recommend thinking about freedom of the press Press freedom means you have the information you need to make up your own mind  And you have the ability to speak out  Nowadays  if you share links on Facebook or tweet on Twitter or chat on Snapchat  youre a part of the media and you benefit from the constitutional protection of the free press Now  those social media sites and apps are owned by private companies  with their own rules that sometimes restrict free expression  This is an issue that were going to be grappling with for years to come But those sites enable hundreds of millions of people to participate in the news process  providing eyewitness information and new perspectives  The web has enabled countless people  myself included  to become bloggers and reporters and commentators The remedy for hoaxes and other forms of misinformation was for members of the public be more careful consumers of media  and to resist government attempts to devalue and delegitimize journalism  Stelter argued But now  rather than standing up for InfoWars right to free speech  Stelter appears to have backed his channels efforts to boycott and ban the Alex Jones Channel On Saturday  he retweeted news about 20th Century Fox withdrawing its ads from the channel The Alex Jones Channel on YouTube has existed for over ten years and has over 1 5 billion views This article has been updated to include YouTubes denial  via CNN Joel B  Pollak is Senior

Thursday on Fox News Channels Tucker Carlson Tonight  host Tucker Carlson said President Donald Trump was betraying core campaign promises on gunswhen he said on Wednesday to take the guns first  go through due process second at a White House meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers on gun laws Partial transcript as follows The shortcomings of this administration are clear  They are usually worth it though  for two reasons  First  the ideas the president ran on are basically right  America first ought to be the principle of every administration by definition its an American administration  America should be first  But thats not the motto of most administrations  Not even hardly  Second  the alternatives to what we have now are scary and getting scarier  The Democratic Party is completely irresponsible and increasingly anti American  They prefer illegal aliens to our middle class  Its true and terrifying  Somebody needs to defend the country from these people  Trump mostly does that  So for these reasons  most of the presidents supporters have stuck by him no matter what has happened  and a lot has happened  But there is a limit to the tolerance  They will not tolerate  and they shouldnt have to tolerate  by the way  betrayal on the core promises of his campaign  And it seems to be happening on guns  unfortunately A few days ago  the president called for raising the minimum age for buying a gun to 21  By the way  thats four years after we let people join the military  They can joint at 17  But he is saying you cant buy a gun until you are 21  Nobody is even arguing this will save actual lives because there is no research that it will  Its propaganda  and sneaky propaganda  by the way  incremental step toward more gun restrictions  Thats all it is  The president went further than thatmet with lawmakers to talk gun control at the White House  At that meeting  he went after Republicans who wanted to defend the Second Amendment  suggesting they are puppets of the NRA  At one point the president said the government should  quote  take the guns first  go through due process second  Now  I mean  how honest do you want to be  Imagine if Barack Obama had said that  Just ignore due process and start confiscating guns  Obama would have been denounced as a dictator  We would have denounced him first  trust me  Congress would be talking impeachment  Some would be muttering success  The media agreedthey underplayed it and suggested a battle between the president and NRA  Its not about the NRA  Its not even about the president  Its about the Constitution  and the Constitution remains the same no matter who is in power  Thats the point of the Constitution Follow Pam Key on Twitter  pamkeyNEN  ,0

I want to do what I can to help make sure we connect these kids together and give them the support they need to withstand the pressure that they are facing inside their schools from administrators and teachers and then also from fellow students  Martin told Breitbart News Sunday  hosted by Washington political editor Matt Boyle and deputy political editor Amanda House on SiriusXM Patriot 125 She said many parents across the country were caught off guard by the event  which was promoted as a way to honor the 17 people who were shot and killed at a Parkland  Florida  high school last month allegedly by a former student with a history of mental health issues The walkout was  in fact  organized and funded by the same left wing groups behind the Womens March  including Planned Parenthood and the George Soros funded moveon org  and morphed into an anti Trump  anti National Rifle Association  gun control protest that spilled out of schools into the streets The left is clearly organizing the kids  by those  who want to take away our rights  and I just want to make sure that those who want to stand up for our rights in a very hostile environment have the support they need  Martin said One of the questions on the survey asked about whether respondents were aware of another nationwide walkout planned for April 20 Martin said that some 60 percent of the people taking the survey said they were not aware Martin told Breitbart News Sunday that  as a mother of teenagers  she wants to be vigilant about not doing what the left is doing  which she referred as the egregious way it is using students to advance its political agenda I just want to be able to help them organize and find out what they think would be the best way to do this in their schools and see if we can get consensus among them and then give them the tools to be able to do that  Martin said Martin said the left is extremely organized in its efforts to use students  teachers  and even administrators and that those who support the Second Amendment and citizens right to bear arms need to step up Please take the survey  Martin said  Share it with everyone you know who has school age children or school age grandchildren  and if they are a student or a teacher  share it with them and ask them to fill it out so we can help connect them If we know how to organize people around this country  we can give them the tools to stand and speak for themselves  Martin said According to the radical Indivisible website  another walkout is planned on April 20  the anniversary of the Columbine High School shooting You can find the Tea Party Patriots survey here Breitbart News Sunday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 7 p m  to 10 p m  Eastern Follow Penny Starr on Twitter ,0
In the days and months leading up to last weeks mass murder in Parkland  Florida  the American people did their job  They saw something and they said something  numerous times  Local and federal law enforcement were warned Again and again and again  bloody red flags popped up around this monster  Still  government balls were dropped  government ineptitude reigned  government bureaucracy stalled  Whatever the inexcusable and catastrophic reasons are  that does not matter  What matters is this Seventeen innocent people died because they were unarmed and helpless  because their government failed at its primary job  to protect the life of its citizens Knowing these facts  Democrats and their media allies are still rabid to exploit this latest government failure as a means to provoke and promote even more government failures In the wake of Parkland  this is the lefts thought process 1  Although there is no gun control law anyone can come up with that would have stopped a single one of these mass shootings  their solution is to 2  Pass laws that make it even more difficult for law abiding citizens to protect themselves against mass murderers  even though it has been proven time and again that the government cannot get to these schools before the killer has time to reload and reload again 3  Continue to place our children in gun free zones where they have no protection whatsoever 4  Proudly and publicly advertise to the world that these gun free zones are filled with sitting ducks  our children 5  Tell us we cannot arm qualified teachers and school guards  even though dozens can be murdered before the police finally arrive This is madness  Especially in a world where the media is working overtime to give these mass murderers all the publicity they crave  which will only inspire more With the government proving again and again that they cannot protect our children  with the obscene push to disarm us turning into a 24 7 propaganda crusade  if I had school aged kids  I would be pulling them out of any gun free environment to either home school them or place them in a private school that cares enough to offer adequate protection Most of all  though  the Parkland tragedy is a stark and heartbreaking reminder that only a fool depends on the government for anything  much less saving your life The lesson of Parkland is that every law abiding American must arm themselves and learn how to safely use and store these firearms  Because even when the government does do its job  they are going to arrive after it is too late How many children have to die before we decide to adequately protect them Follow John Nolte on Twitter  NolteNC  Follow his Facebook Page here ,0
The results of this cynical and desperate crusade have not only exposed these provincial elites as completely opposed to keeping our children safe  but as liars  and morons Here are the 16 most dishonest and or stupidest things we have heard so far CNN expert Tom Fuentes says we should not arm trained and qualified teachers because most teachers are girls and girls cant conceal a gun when they dress like girls If you wear a dress  if you wear a skirt  are you going to have to wear a jacket everyday with a belt and a holster  the way a detective on duty would do  Fuentes asked  Its not a real practical solution for a variety of reasons MSNBCs Lawrence ODonnell figured out that it is dumb to arm qualified school personnel because the bullet from an AR 15 travels three times faster than the bullet from a concealed pistol Lawrence  A bullet fired from an AR 15 travels 3x faster than one from a handgun   And yet the president and the NRA think giving teachers guns will stop a school shooter  https t co heze69kRDU  MSNBC  MSNBC  February 23  2018 This speed difference gives the killer plenty of time to get off his shot and to move out of the way of the bullet you fired because The Matrix is real  yall These are direct quotes When the shooting started  there was an armed deputy on duty at the school  someone tasked  specifically  with keeping the students inside safe  He was outside when the first shots were fired  And he stayed there for four minutes as the shooter murdered 17 people There was agood guywith a gun just outside the school when the bad guy with a gun started murdering people  Thegood guywith the gun wasnt the solution  He didnt stop it It is so odd that no one watches CNN Never go the full George Takei The NRA sells guns to Americans  then when those guns get used for the purpose for which they were designed  the NRA sells Americans ways to fortify against the effects of those guns  Quite a racket they have going And their biggest pitchman is sitting in the White House  George Takei  GeorgeTakei  February 23  2018 Those of you not old enough to remember when the Weekly Standard was a conservative publication will not be surprised by this  but everyones favorite cruise sponsors have now sided with MSNBC on the issue of arming trained and qualified teachers Okay  so they are talking about that other Chekhov  but the rationale for leaving people vulnerable and helpless is still equal parts pretentious and anti science States and municipalities may wish to try different policies  but arming so many teachers across the nation would increase the danger  not alleviate it  School shootings are a problem  but the odds of any one school being attacked is still  thankfully  minuscule  Put a gun in the classroom  and it might well become like Chekhovs gun  Eventually  somebodys going to use it Odd  how in this quest to seek approval from the elite media  the Weekly Standard fails to mention those school districts that already allow concealed carry  and have for years  without incident This exchange is pure gold Someone claims the debacle that was that CNN anti gun town hall was scripted Student to Bill Nelson  What's it like to have blood on your hands  killer Bill Nelson  Jake Tapper  Senator you don't have to answer that  That's for  DLoesch CNN  We didn't script anything This is CNN https t co WSEXX2GVBa  Sean Davis  seanmdav  February 22  2018 Jake Tapper indignantly says no it wasnt and the transcript proves it This is so dishonest  The student said her question was for Dana  Thats why I said that  Read the transcript   And no  nothing is scripted  But people submit questions and we go to them expecting they will ask the questions they submitted  which theyre holding  https t co iCKEtZkurP  Jake Tapper  jaketapper  February 23  2018 Okay  so heres the transcript  which clearly shows that because Dana Loesch was not available  the student chose instead to ask a Democrat an uncomfortable question  which Tapper jumped in to ensure didnt happen Here's the transcripthttps t co VmQFIf32Ww pic twitter com vNPKNcyBHa  Robert Maguire  RobertMaguire  February 23  2018 Yep  not scripted AT ALL Another reminder that Democrats are incapable of shame Actual quotes In a tweet Thursday  President Donald Trump described someone who would shoot up a school as a savage sicko  And at a White House briefing Thursday  the President again used the term sicko Rosesaid that calling the shooter a sicko is insulting and mean minded How helpful is calling a black person the n word  Not only is it disrespectful  it fans racism Vice Media is freaking out over the idea that women might carry guns Could this be why C ivilians dont understand  that  in close quarters the first thing you are going to have to experience is the explosive sound of the weapon going off  not yours but the shooters  the Expert expertsplained Where does our media find people willing to sacrifice their integrity on the altar of ideology like this You are going to hear the gunshot  regardless  So the noise of the gun has nothing to do with anything  The question is would you rather hear the gun while trembling under a desk waiting to die like an animal  or like a human being on your feet and fighting back David Hogg frequently uses the argument that eventually his side will win the gun control debate because those of us who do not want to give up our Second Amendment right will eventually die off  leaving the young and dumb to take over the world The only problem with this reasoning is that as people grow older  wiser  and more experienced  they overwhelmingly vote conservative  which means that in 25 years  Hoggs generation will become conservative During her basement rated CNN morning show  Alisyn Camerota said absolutely nothing when one of her guests described the NRA as child murderers A few days later  when called her out on that silence  Camerota chanted I dont believe you  I dont believe you  And I dont believe you   13  Ben Stein  Ban Guns Cuz Sylvester Stallone I think its a damn good idea to ban the AR 15  Stein said  An AR 15 is a weapon thats extremely seductive  it looks like a weapon of war  Makes a person whos a big nerd be able to go into a gun shop  buy it  come out feeling like hes Rambo The dumb brother strikes again After the cold medicine comparison was debunked  CBS

 Runcie admitted the district was going through a journey after the shooting  saying  We hadnt really thought how we would plan for something like this  We are in some ways learning as we go through the process Angry students and parents lashed out at Runcie and a panel of school officials  several calling for his dismissal and the election of a new school board  during the forum held just one week after the board unanimously votednot to allow armed school employees per a new state law Parents and students were allowed one minute each during the forum to address their concerns about the security of the districts schools and its school disciplinary policies  Many expressed outrage that Cruz  despite an extensive history of violence and threats  had never been expelled or arrested  Without those red flags appearing in a background check to warn authorities  the shooter was able to obtain a firearm Runcie also admitted families of the shooting victims have not received the kind of outreach that they should have from district officials Most who attended the emotionally charged forum were not only enraged that Cruz was able to accomplish the shooting of so many individuals without interference by law enforcement  but also that school officials remain unresponsive to security concerns in the districts schools  even after the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas  MSD  High School One MSD student confronted Runcie with his assertion that he has attended four Broward County schools and only saw Runcie for the first time recently at a gathering for a shooting victim You said we dont need to arm teachers with guns  we need to arm them with more money in their pockets  the student said  Yet teacher salaries have been frozen for the past eight years or so  and you have been cutting their benefits year after year My question for you is  Did you do everything in your power before the tragedy happened at MSD to prevent it from happening  and will you do everything in your power to prevent this from happening in every other Broward County school  he asked My answer to that is unequivocally  yes  Runcie replied Several parents were outraged that the school district ignored offers of free security upgrades prior to the shooting on February 14  Other parents and students asserted security was inconsistent across schools in the district Two female students from Charles Flanagan High School in Pembroke Pines described a fearful situation when a student with a knife threatened 20 fellow students  The two students said the school failed to address their concerns about the incident and that the student with the knife was suspended  but then simply returned to school Another student said the new clear backpack policyput in place since the shooting was not being enforced  She said she decided to test security by also bringing to school a side bag that was not clear  The student told school officials at the forum that security personnel never even checked her side bag Why do we have clear backpacks if they arent being enforced  she asked  Why do we have BSO everywhere if they arent doing their job and just seem to be hanging around our campus Many parents and students were angry that they received no responses from Runcie or his office to their emails containing concerns or questions While two students from the districts PROMISE program  an Obama era program aimedat ending the school to prison pipeline for black  Hispanic  LGBT  and disabled students  defended the program as one that gave them a second chance  many at the forum wanted answers to why Cruz had never been expelled or arrested Runcie has saidassertions that his PROMISE program is connected to the shooting are fake news because Cruz did not participate in that program RealClearInvestigations  however  reportedCruz was enrolled in the districts Behavior Intervention Program  a program for students returning from residential Juvenile Justice Programs  including students convicted of a serious crime such as  rape  murder  attempted murder  sexual battery or firearm related and those whose behavior off campus would qualify them for expulsion At the school safety forum  Runcie said he has no knowledge of Cruzs being involved in the Behavior Intervention Program Student Support Initiatives Executive Director Michaelle Pope described the behavioral support programs as complex  She said the programs in place are in compliance with federal and state laws  local law enforcement  and child protection agencies  Pope added the school districts policies are also monitored by external child advocacy groups such as the ACLU  the NAACP  gay rights advocacy group Human Rights Campaign  and the Southern Poverty Law Center After describing both the PROMISE and Behavior Intervention Programs  Pope said  There is a very different process that must occur if a child has a disability Pope said students identified as disabled are treated differently  via state statute  when they have behavior problems Students with disabilities cannot be suspended or expelled from school for more than ten days per year without the provision of a free and appropriate public education  she continued at the safety forum The Weekly Standardreportedlast week that Pope  referring to Cruz  who was in a special education program  said  This is not an average student  He has a disability One student announced his belief that only more restrictive gun control laws would bring about greater safety  When he asked Runcie how greater gun control could be enacted  Runcie encouraged him to register to vote and vote for people who have been calling for restrictions on gun rights ,0

Thursday on NBCs Today  host Megyn Kelly offered her thoughts in a monologue aboutgun control and mental illness on the heels of the Parkland  FL school shooting Partial transcript as follows There have been at least 12  at least 12  school shootings in America so far in 2018  Its February 15  Were averaging one just about every three or four days  How we doing  America  Everyone okay with that  Apparently the answer is in fact yes because we havent done virtually anything to stop it  We havent done virtually anything  We all know what is about to happen right now  dont we  Were going to say how sorry and shocked and sad we are  and then were going to move on without doing anything  And then well express how sorry and shocked and sad we are at the next one  and the one after that  Does anyone really think that we are going to do anything about these mass murders I dont  I dont believe that  I dont believe in a single one of these politicians  I dont believe any of them have the courage it takes to push through reform  Why  Because history  And lets face it  lets face it  Its not all on them because we the people  who hire and fire these politicians so if we dont get serious  neither will they Five years ago I was live on the air and pregnant with my third child when 20 first graders were shot to death in school in Newtown  Connecticut  That was the one  That was the one where we all thought now we will do something  Now we have to change  But we didnt  In fact  since Newtown  there have been nearly 300 school shootings in America  about one a week  If 20 dead first graders dont spur people to action  what will  Yes  there was an act signed into law by President Obama just about 15 months ago targeting mental health reforms  It pushes for early intervention for kids showing signs of mental illness  but guess what  it hasnt been funded by Congress  Its a beautiful piece of paper  Im sure its a great comfort to the folks in Florida today We had a woman on this show just last week jumping up and down  a mother  trying to warn people that her own son is a potential danger  Shes seen it  She said hes been killing animals  consuming dark and disturbing pornography  and no one will help her  She said their social worker dumped the family after learning how disturbed her son was  What could possibly go wrong  And then there is the truth that mental instability by itself is not a great predictor of a mass shooting  Most mentally ill people do not commit murder  So even if we fund the mental health reforms  how do we find the potentially deadly needles in these haystacks who are likely to blow We could start by paying attention  Paying attention to things like Facebook posts with ominous gun pictures coupled with social alienation and other red flag warning signs  But then what  Then what  Are we really going to loosen the standards for involuntary commitment in this country  Even if we could pay for that  good luck convincing theACLU that its legal  And then there are the guns  Dont even think about it  Dont even think about it  No gun reforms are getting through  Theyre not  And most of the ones that will be proposed in the wake of this shooting will be utterly meaningless and wouldnt have even arguably prevented this killing  TheNRA is too powerful  our politicians are too weak  and the guns are too ubiquitous Guess how many guns there are in America  do you know  Over 300 million  They say 6 to 10 million AE 15s like the one reportedly used in Florida  So now weve seen it a million times  Were going to debate that gun  But any semiautomatic pistol can unleash carnage  There was no AR 15 at Virginia Tech and that remains the worst school shooting in U S  history  32 dead and nothing changed  Nothing  Can it  In the meantime  I and other parents have to send our kids to play and play Russian Roulette with their lives  My children  like yours  have to practice hiding in the bathroom to avoid an active shooter and dont even think about letting the teacher lead a prayer to get them through that moment because the guns are perfectly legal  but the prayers are not  I wish I had the solution  One part of it is courage to get honest  to give a damn  To maybe take that  25 billion for the border wall and redirect it towards this problem  How about showing any resolve at all  Any resolve at all to actually solve this problem  Wouldnt that be a start Follow Pam Key on Twitter  pamkeyNEN ,0

According to the March of Our Liveswebsite  hundreds of cities across the country and even around the world will be protesting on Saturday in favor of gun restrictions  including banning certain types of guns  age limits for gun purchases  and background checks required for every gun sale The Associated Press is reporting that as many as one million people will attend the main march in D C  and the National Park Service  NPS  issued a permit showing it is planning for 500 000 people on and around the National Mall on Saturday The march in D C  officially begins at noon along Pennsylvania Avenue  but the National Park Service permit puts the official time for the spaces being reserved from 6 00 a m  to 8 00 p m The Florida teens spotlighted by the media leading up to the march say it is about youth and its gun control message  but documents show that adults are responsible for much of the D C  event and so called sibling marches  including putting into place the logistics necessary to pull it off The March for Our Lives Action Fund  for example  was registered with the District of Columbia Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs on Feb  21  2018 as a Deleware based organization with a business address in Encino  California The agent for the fund is listed as CT Corporation System  a D C based firm that handles compliance issues  Jeri Rhodes is listed as the executing officer for the filing Rhodes is the Associate Executive Secretary for Finance and Administration for the Friends Committee on National Legislation  which is a Quaker lobbying group with the goal to advance peace and justice Rhodes LinkedIn profile states that she once worked for Greenpeace BuzzFeed News spoke with some of the major players behind the march last month Major players and organizations  including Everytown  Giffords  Move On  and Womens March LA  told BuzzFeed News they are helping with logistics  strategy  and planning for next months March for Our Lives rally and beyond  Much of the specific resources the groups are providing to the Parkland students remains unclear  as is the full list of supporting organizations  but there are broad outlines Giffords  an organization started by former Rep  Gabrielle Giffords  D AZ  that fights gun violence  is working with Everytown and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America to plan the main march on Washington  as well as sister rallies across the country A spokesperson for Giffords told BuzzFeed News that it is lending support in any way the students need  especially helping to operationalize these marches from logistics to programming We applaud these students for demonstrating incredible leadership and demanding that our lawmakers do more to help protect Americans from gun violence  the Giffords spokesperson said in the BuzzFeed News report Planned Parenthood and the George Soros funded Move On are also in the mix of left wing groups behind the march BuzzFeed News reported  MoveOn said it will encourage its millions of members to follow and promote the March for Our Lives movement on social media and attend the rally and would help with security and other logistics A spokesperson for Planned Parenthood said it is teaching and hosting trainings for teens to keep momentum going so they dont get burned out  BuzzFeed News reported The NPS permit reveals persons in charge of the D C  event  including Deena Katz  the co executive producer of Dancing with the Stars who helped organized the Los Angeles Womens March Other persons in charge are Matt Hall  Ann Marie Hoffman  Paul Sorenson  and James Day March for Our Lives also started a GoFundMe page that has raised  3 3 million  The text on the page states The funds will be spent on the incredibly difficult and expensive process that is organizing a march like this  We have people making more specific plans  but for now  know that this is for the march and everything left over will be going to the victims funds NBA Miami Heat player Dewayne Wade donated  200 000 to the march and urged others to do the same on Twitter earlier this month They need our help  I'm asking my NBA fam to join us in raising money to send kids from underserved communities to March gabunion and I will start w 200K for Chicago  every dollar counts   Who else is in  Or donate here  https t co pu10Gp76on  GetTheBallRollin  DWade  DwyaneWade  March 10  2018 There is no list of supporters or donors on the March for Our Lives official website  and a map of the locations for all the marches allegedly taking place on Saturday includes this cryptic message  Note that information on accessing grants to support sibling marches will be emailed directly to registered host organizers The NPS permit reveals more about the event  including the event overview  which states Approximately  500 000  student participants and adults from across the country  will no longer risk their lives waiting for someone else to take action to stop the epidemic of mass school shootings that has become all too familiar  In the tragic wake of the seventeen lives brutally cut shot in Florida  politicians are telling us that now is not the time to talk about guns  March for Our Lives believes the time is now The permit also says that the organizers have to spend millions on insurance for the event Procure public and employee liability insurance from responsible companies with a minimum limitation of  2 000 000 per person for any one claim and an aggregate limit of  5 000 000 for any number of claims arising from any one incident  The United States of America shall be named as an additional insured on all such policies  The permit number will be included on said policy There are also a number of celebrities that are taking part in the march  and some are performing  The March for our Lives website notes that Jennifer Hudson  Ariana Grande  Demi Lovato  Common  Vic Mensa  Andra Day  and Miley Cyrus are scheduled for the event So proud to stand with these brave students and the movement theyre leading   IWillMarch  MarchForOurLives https t co w0yLAORaVJ https t co g1EgmKc6He  Jennifer Hudson  IAMJHUD  March 15  2018 Nonetheless  the Florida students who are credited with organizing the march insist it is teens  not adults  who are in charge  while admitting adults are involved Cameron Kasky  17  acknowledged that the anti Trump group Indivisible is helping and said that their assistance is necessary because of the role race allegedly plays in school shootings Kasky said in an interview on Friday with National Public Radio You know our story was told because we are an affluent white community and we have to shine the spotlight that was given on us on everybody in the world that has to deal with this on a daily basis  So people like Indivisible  who represent students who are in lower income communities and dont get to speak out the way we do because people dont listen  we have to connect with these students The March for Our Lives Twitter account also features a video with students stating the anti gun talking points used by left wing groups regularly  including blaming the National Rifle Association for school shootings We see these lawmakers representing the NRA  and not their constituents  We see our leaders making excuses and refusing to act  On Saturday  theyll see US  pic twitter

A lot of people are going with this line of reasoning where they say  people in show business shouldnt speak out about politics  Jimmy Kimmel told in an interview with ABC News Paula Faris on Tuesday  And yet  they electedDonald Trumpthe president of the United States  So I think that argument has pretty well jumped out the window Most recently  theLivehost has pushed political views like amnesty for illegal immigrants  gun control  and tax payer subsidized healthcare  all while skewering President Trump and his supporters I dont think you can go too far  Kimmel says of his politically charged rhetoric  Im still doing a comedy show and I need to be funny and entertain my audience  but I also think that weve matured enough  to the point where we can accept late night talk show hosts speaking about a serious subject  And I think that its almost necessary now The ABC star is set to return to host the 90thAcademy Awards on Sunday and says he doesnt have plans to crack jokes about Hollywoods widespread sexual misconduct scandal during the show This show is not about reliving peoples sexual assaults  Kimmel said Its an awards show for people who have been dreaming about maybe winning an Oscar for their whole lives  And the last thing I want to do is ruin that for someone who is nominated for  you know  best leading actress or best supporting or best director or cinematographer or whatever  by making it unpleasant Im not going to stop any bad behavior with my jokes  he said FollowJerome Hudsonon Twitter jeromeehudson ,0

Venezuelan Chief Prosecutor Tarek William Saab said on Wednesday that the dead included 66 men and two women  who were evidently visiting inmates at the prison when the fire broke out  He said four prosecutors have been assigned to investigate the incident and immediately shed light on the painful events that have put dozens of Venezuelan families in mourning We urge the Venezuelan authorities to carry out a prompt  thorough and effective investigation to establish the cause of these deaths  provide reparations to the victims families  and  where applicable  identify and bring those responsible to justice  the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement on the tragedy Human rights groups have long complained about overcrowded and inhumane conditions in Venezuelan jails  The political opposition claims conditions have grown much worse under dictator Nicols Maduro Among other offenses  prison officials have been accused of holding detainees much longer than the initial 48 hour period mandated under Venezuelan law and abusing detainees  who have protested their hideous conditions with numerous hunger strikes  There are reports of small temporary holding cells at police stations repurposed as long term holding facilities stuffed with hundreds of prisoners  who often die from disease and malnutrition  or are killed by other prisoners Venezuelan inmates have reported they were forced to eat rats and pigeons  and in the most extreme cases other prisoners  to avoid starvation  Allegations of torture ranging from sleep deprivation to electroshock have been made  Attempts to massacre prisoners wholesale have been reported The only culprit is the government  which keeps a huge quantity of prisoners crammed together in police office cells for a long time in inhumane conditions  declared opposition lawmaker Yajaira Forero after news of the jailhouse fire and riot emerged The desperation of relatives should not be played with  added lawmaker Juan Miguel Matheus  criticizing the authorities for waiting far too long to inform the families of prisoners about the condition of their loved ones  The authorities claim they withheld estimated casualty counts out of respect for the families One watchdog group cited unconfirmed reports that a prisoner was able to gain possession of a gun and shoot a jail officer in the leg   This might not have been a case of the prisoner wrestling a firearm away from a guard  Venezuelan prisons are notorious for corrupt guards helping prisoners obtain drugs and weapons  ranging from knives and machetes to machine guns and hand grenades A fire was evidently set or accidentally started during the ensuing riot  and spread rapidly through the mattresses in the cells  Some reports claim the fire was set deliberately to facilitate an escape attempt and grew out of control ,0

The National Rifle Association is right to support President Trumps call for state level Emergency Risk Protection Orders  ERPOs   under which a court can take guns in rare situations for just a few days when there is evidence that a person may be on the verge of extreme violence  because  if written properly  such temporary measures are consistent with the original meaning of the Constitutions Second Amendment and Due Process Clause President Trump supports states passing laws to allow for ERPOs  Details are still being developed and so reports may be updated as legislative debate begins  But the basic concept is that if a family member informs law enforcement that their loved one is spiraling out of control into violence  and swears an affidavit giving the details  under penalty of perjury  so the informant can go to prison if they are lying  then a judge could issue an ERPO to temporarily confiscate weapons in that persons possession Within a very short period  perhaps just three days  the person whose weapons were seized could demand a court to review the ERPO  The burden would be on the government to show  perhaps by clear and convincing evidence  a very difficult standard to meet   that the person truly is at least temporarily a danger to himself or to others  If so  then the police can continue to hold the weapons while further proceedings take place If the government cannot produce that much evidence  then the weapons must be immediately returned to the owner This is very different from a regime like Californias law  In California  an ERPO  called a gun violence restraining order in that state  requires only substantial evidence  meaning you have to show something significant  but far less than a 51 percent likelihood  that a person is dangerous  If that minimal evidentiary standard is met  then police can take away all weapons from that person for 21 days  After those 21 days  then it can be extended for a full year if the petitioner presents clear and convincing evidence that a person is dangerous  and possibly extended even further The NRA strongly opposed as unconstitutional Californias ERPOs  but support states adopting ERPO laws as outlined by President Trump   These laws are properly left to the states under the Constitutions Tenth Amendment as part of a states core police powers over public safety and public health  The Constitution gives no such powers to the federal government How does President Trumps recommendation square with the Constitution  which the NRA has fought to protect since 1871 The Second Amendment includes  the right of the people to keep and bear Arms  shall not be infringed  The First Amendment has similar language in its Free Speech Clause  which provides  Congress shall make no law  abridging the freedom of speech Both the First and Second Amendments were written by the First Congress in 1789 and ratified by the states in 1791 as parts of the original Bill of Rights to the U S  Constitution  Neither of them was an absolute right  For any principled constitutional originalist  the question would be what it meant in 1791 to abridge the freedom of speech or infringe upon the right to keep and bear arms The Supreme Court over the decades has looked at various kinds of speech that were not protected as part of the freedom of speech in 1791  so restricting or banning such speech is not abridging First Amendment rights  The kinds of speech that are not protected by free speech rights include  perjury  defamation  slander and libel  advocating lawlessness  obscenity  false statements to law enforcement  fighting words  child pornography  fraud  threats  and imminent threats to public order So too with the Second Amendment  The right applies only to law abiding and peaceable adult American citizens  As Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his historic Supreme Court opinion in District of Columbia v  Heller  2008  Constitutional rights are enshrined with the scope they were understood to have when the people adopted them  whether or not future legislatures or  yes  even future judges think that scope is too broad The Second Amendment did not to apply to foreigners  children  dangerous criminals  or dangerous  mentally defective people  It also applies only to arms  not to any sort of explosive device  called ordnance in 1791  devices that an average adult could not carry  bear  over significant distances  or to certain types of bizarre weapons that inspired fear in average people  called affrighting in the eighteenth century Scalia noted in Heller that there were longstanding prohibitions on gun ownership that were consistent with the Second Amendment  adding that there will be time enough to expound upon the historical justifications for the exceptions we have mentioned if and when those exceptions come before us The challenge is determining what sort of people are not peaceable  It is easy to determine if a person is a citizen or an adult  It is slightly more difficult to define law abiding  a term that should definitely exclude violent felons but include people who in modern terms write a bad check or get a speeding ticket  But many people agree on certain standards for lawful conduct  which point to the constitutional line separating law abiding people from dangerous criminals who have forfeited their gun rights ERPOs are based on determining that a person might not be peaceable  However  the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment commands  No State shall  deprive any person of life  liberty  or property  without due process of law In other words  a person can be deprived of their rights and their property  but only after due process of law that satisfies the U S  Constitution It is a very demanding standard to meet The task is identifying people who are truly dangerous but have never been convicted of a disqualifying crime  Truly dangerous people have no Second Amendment rights  but a person who is merely depressed because of a serious illness or the death of a loved one and is seeking help from a counselor is not constitutionally disqualified as a menace The Second Amendment continues to apply to people going through a tough time  but who still understand and embrace the difference between right and wrong As Judge Alice Batchelder of the U S  Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit wrote in her concurring opinion in the Second Amendment case Tyler v  Hillsdale County Sheriffs Department  2016  By examining the Founding generations conception of right  as well as the principles of Founding era mental health law  we can come to a quite definite conclusion in this case Batchelder explained that in 1791  according to Founding era legal definitions  an insane person was someone who had lost his reason  She continued  An insane person was similar to a minor who had not yet attained the age of reason  both were unable  by definition  to exercise their rights because rights could  in the central case  be exercised only by those possessing reason This understanding was well reflected in Founding era legal doctrine  Batchelder added  then explained the various laws and procedures by which a persons rights could be restricted in 1791 because that person was experiencing serious mental or emotional illness Significantly  such deprivations were not once for all  she noted  then described the process whereby people with mental illnesses could be restored to all their rights as American citizens It might be argued that guns should be subject to different rules because they are so dangerous  wrote Batchelder  But while the dangerousness of guns may be relevant when considering what sort of showing someone must make to get his gun rights back  that fact cannot justify treating gun rights as fundamentally different from other rights She quotes Justice Samuel Alito  who wrote in the only other historic Supreme Court case to date on the Second Amendment  McDonald v  Chicago  2010  that the Second Amendment is not a second class right  subject to an entirely different body of rules than other Bill of Rights guarantees Less obvious to the contemporary judicial mind are the Founding era fears of tyranny and defenselessness that provided the impetus behind the Second Amendment  Batchelder opines on how to consider gun rights in light of mental illness  What is not debatable is that we  are not philosopher kings empowered to fix things according to the dictates of what we fancy is our superior insight  nor rubber stamps  approving whatever laws the legislatures of this country happen to pass While the details of these ERPO laws must be examined carefully  President Trumps proposal and the NRAs support for it may very well result in state laws that are completely consistent with the Constitutions rights to bear arms and due process  and Americas almost 100 million gun owners should be satisfied that their rights are fully protected by a president and a flagship organization determined to uphold those rights Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News  Follow him on Twitter  kenklukowski ,0

The above lines  taken from the Passover Haggadah  are recited by Jews all over the world during the festive meal  or seder  that is the essence of the holiday  We are commanded not merely to commemorate the Exodus from Egypt and the passage from slavery to freedom  but to recall it  to retell it  and to re enact it as if we had personally been there The re enactment is symbolic  We do not literally cross through a body of water on dry land to tell the story of the Red Sea  Rather  we dip parsley  or another suitable vegetable  in salt water  But we tell the story to each other  taking ownership of it  recalling it as a personal memory rather than as a literary text or historical tale This past week  we have seen Americans argue  once again  over the Second Amendment  The young gun control activist Cameron Kasky declared that the Second Amendment was outdated because it was written when African Americans were still considered 3 5ths of a person Conservatives point out that the Second Amendment exists to allow citizens to resist tyranny  a concern very much on the minds of the Framers of the Constitution  But that message does not always hit home  because the threat of tyranny seems very remote  as outdated as the quill and parchment with which the Constitution was written Imagine if we Americans learned  and taught  our history not as something that happened in the past  but as an experience that we ourselves had lived through  The lessons of freedom would seem immediately relevant  and not just from 1789  We could share the experience of the Emancipation Proclamation  and other watershed events  in much the same way Passover reminds us that if the values we hold dearest are embedded deeply in our history  we owe it to ourselves not to see that history as something past  but as something very much alive in everything we do and everything we are Joel B  Pollak is Senior Editor at Large at Breitbart News  He was named to Forwards 50 most influential Jews in 2017  He is the co author ofHow Trump Won  The Inside Story of a Revolution  which is available from Regnery  Follow him on Twitter at  joelpollak Maxwell House edition ,0
His call for a ban on semi automatic firearms was followed by other tweets in which he told Americans that the Second Amendment was never intended to protect an individual right to keep and bear arms  Rather  it was only intended to protect militias members ability to be armed Regarding a ban on semi automatic firearms  Morgan tweeted I think ALL semi automatic guns should be banned  just as automatic guns are banned  No civilian needs one except to kill a lot of people very quickly  https t co vvC5XGuPVq  Piers Morgan  piersmorgan  April 2  2018 Morgans call overlooks the fact that millions upon millions of semi automatic firearms are carried every day in America by licensed concealed permit holders  The firearms are a weapon of choice because they allow the vulnerable  who may not be physically strong  to carry a tool with which they can defend their lives  This is becausea semi automatic firearm uses it own recoil to cycle the next round into the chamber  thereby reducing the felt recoil and allowing petite individualsand persons who may have physical limitationsto carry a firearm with a round large enough to stop attackers In another tweet  Morgan explained his call for a ban on semi automatic firearms by saying he fired an AR 15 rapidly  What he did not mention is the fact that an AR 15 or a Glock handgun or a Smith   Wesson double action revolver will all shoot as fast as you pull the trigger but there is a difference between shooting fast and shooting accurately  In other words  shooting rapidly often undercuts the guns usefulness Morgans calls for an all out ban on semi automatics came exactly one week and former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stephens called for a repeal of the Second Amendment and just days after gun control proponent Chelsea Handler said her armed guardsdont have semi automatic weapons His call for a ban on semi automatic firearms comes just over a week after Matthew McConaughy called for a ban on assault weapons and just prior to Rep  Debbie Dingells  D Mich  introduction of firearm confiscation legislation Yet we are supposed to believe the left does not want to take away our guns AWRHawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News  the hostof the Breitbart podcastBullets with AWR Hawkins  and the writer curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment  also for Breitbart News  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter AWRHawkins  Reach him directly atawrhawkins breitbart com  Sign up to get Down Range atbreitbart com downrange ,0
All the  terrorists were liquidated immediately before they could reach the outer gate of the anti terrorism headquarters  the Aden police said in a statement  reports Reuters  noting that the attack took place Saturday Security sources and medics said three security men  a woman  and two children died in the attack  while 40 other people  many of them civilians  were wounded  notes the news outlets In a statement disseminated by ISISs Amaq news agency  the jihadist organization said it carried out two martyrdom operations targeting the military camp in southwestern Aden Months after ISIS declared the establishment of its now annihilated caliphate in Iraq and Syria  the group announced its presence in Yemen However  the Yemen based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula  AQAP  remains the most prominent of the two Sunni terrorist groups in the country where a Saudi Arabia led coalition has been combating Iran allied Shiite Houthi  or Huthi  rebels since March 2015 In late December  the U S  military revealed that it had conducted multiple ground operations and more than 120 strikes in 2017 to cripple AQAP and ISIS in Yemen Now  Reuters reports ISIS has claimed responsibility for the recent deadly assaults  noting The attack was the first of its kind in southern Yemen since gun battles erupted in January between southern separatists and President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadis government over control of the city  Aden is the temporary capital of Yemens internationally recognized Hadi government  which is now operating out of Saudi Arabia The Saudi led coalition has been fighting the Houthi rebels to restore President Hadi to power The war in Yemen is likely to continue for the foreseeable future because the Iranian backed Huthis and the Saudi led coalition remain far apart on terms for ending the conflict  notes the American intelligence community in its most recent Worldwide Threat Assessment  The death of former Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Salih is only likely to further complicate the conflict as the Huthis and others scramble to win over those who previously backed Salih We assess that the Huthis will continue to pursue their goals militarily and that  as a result  US allies and interests on the Arabian Peninsula will remain at risk of Huthi missile attacks until the conflict is resolved  it adds ,0
On January 20  the Trice Edney News Wire published the 2005 photo of Obama with Farrakhan  The news agency quoted photographer Askia Muhammad as saying that after the picture was snapped at a meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus  Muhammad was approached by a caucus member who asked him not to use the image I gave the original disk to him and in a sense swore myself to secrecy because I had quietly made a copy for myself  Muhammad told Fox News  Muhammad further said that the Congressional Black Caucus expressed concern the photo could harm Obamas future presidential aspirations As far back as May 2008  this reporter documented Obamas connections to Farrakhan  which largely ran through the former presidents pastor and spiritual advisor for 20 years  Rev  Jeremiah Wright  Jr During the 2008 presidential campaign  Obama distanced himself from Wright months after soundbites of the pastor making anti American and racist remarks first surfaced in the news media Obama sat in the pews of Wrights Trinity United Church for nearly two decades despite the pastors openly extremist positions Obamas face was featured on the cover of Wrights Trumpet magazine alongside Farrakhan and Nation of Islam founder Elijah Muhammad for a 2006 issue titled  The legacy lives on  The issue was first discovered by BizzyBlog com At the time of the discovery  Obamas 2008 presidential campaign did not return a request from this reporter seeking comment on whether the politician was aware that his face had appeared on the cover of Wrights magazine alongside Farrakhans image Obama was featured on the cover of Wrights magazine at least three times  including once with his arm around Wright  and Obama gave an interview to the radical publication Farrakhan also made the cover of a special November December 2007 Trumpetedition promoting Wrights Empowerment Award  which was handed out that year to Farrakhan  The publication hailed Farrakhan as a 20th and 21st century giant It seems inconceivable that  in 20 years  Obama would never have picked up a copy of Trumpet  wrote Stanley Kurtz in a lengthy Weekly Standard expose of Wrights magazine  Obama himself graced the cover   There can be no mistaking it  What did Barack Obama know and when did he know it  Everything  Always Besides gracing the cover of Trumpet with Farrakhans image  Obama in 1995 discussed attending the Million Man March  which was organized by Farrakhan During the 2008 presidential campaign  a 2004 picture surfaced showing Michelle Obama attending an event hosted by Jesse Jacksons Citizenship Education Foundation  Michelle Obama was photographed there with Farrakhans wife Mother Khadijah Farrakhan and five other women During that years presidential campaign  this reporter also documented the ties of David Axelrod  who served as chief strategist to Obamas presidential campaigns and a White House senior adviser  to a church that was closely aligned with Farrakhan I reported at the time Although he is Jewish  Axelrod sits on the finance committee of St  Sabina  the Chicago Catholic parish that was led by controversial pastor Michael Pfleger  an outspoken Farrakhan supporter who hosted the Nation of Islam chief at his parish several times The Archdiocese of Chicago temporarily removed Pfleger from his duties at St  Sabina in 2008 following a well publicized guest sermon at Trinity church in which Pfleger claimed Hillary Clinton cried in public because she thought being white entitled her to the Democratic presidential nomination Pfleger hosted Farrakhan at his church several times  including one May 2007 sermon that was Farrakhans first public appearance since he announced in 2006 he had been suffering from prostate cancer and was seriously ill According to reports  Pfleger spent hours with the Nation of Islam chief during his illness  Pfleger previously enlisted Farrakhans support for several of his initiatives  including an anti gun protest in 2007 In 2015  the Anti Defamation League released an updated  32 page pamphlet titled Farrakhan  In His Own Words  extensively documenting the Nation of Islam leaders anti Semitic  racist  homophobic statements Here are just three paragraphs of that 32 page report  which is filled with Farrakhans hateful quotes In recent years  Farrakhan has embarked on a wide ranging campaign specifically targeting the Jewish community  which has featured some of the most hateful speeches of Farrakhans career as head of the NOI  Farrakhan has alleged that the Jewish people were responsible for the slave trade and that they conspire to control the government  the media  Hollywood and various Black individuals and organizations  He also frequently denies that Jews have a legitimate claim to their religion and to the land of Israel  claiming that Judaism is nothing more than a deceptive lie and a theological error promoted by Jews to further their supposed control over Americas government and economy Farrakhan often promotes such messages at public speeches and sermons  some of which attract thousands of followers  During Part 2 of his 2015 Saviours Day keynote address at the Mosque Maryam in Chicago  Illinois  Farrakhan used his platform to discuss the supposed role of Israel and Jews in orchestrating the 9 11 attacks  claiming that Israelis had foreknowledge of the attacks and that Jews were warned ahead of time not to come to work that day  He then went on to speak more broadly of Israeli control of the American government  stating that Israel and Jews dont fear America because they control it from within Such conspiratorial and hateful rhetoric is frequently a central part of Saviours Day sermons  During his keynote address to 18 000 people at the NOIs 2014 Saviours Day convention at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit  Farrakhan likened himself to auto magnate Henry Ford  who promoted anti Semitic conspiracies in the 1920s in The International Jew  the Worlds Foremost Problem  Farrakhan called Ford a great man who was called an anti Semite and added  I feel like Im in good company  In Part 2 of his Saviours Day address at Mosque Maryam in Chicago  Farrakhan received a standing ovation after telling his audience that the Satanic Jews that control everything and mostly everybody  if they are your enemy  then you must be somebody Aaron Klein is Breitbarts Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative

On Capitol Hill Tuesday  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will be hauled before Congress  not for his ongoing corporate censorship against right of center voices  but for  as Sefton so perfectly puts it  letting the Trump Campaign successfully employ the same data tools that Obama did four years earlier  which everyone thought was just so super cool and savvy Yes  for the sin of not stopping Trump from enjoying the same level playing field as Obama did in 2012  the government and mainstream media are raking Zuckerberg over the coals  almost as if to distract us from the fact that he is censoring black female Trump supporters like Diamond and Silk  but only after labeling them as enemies of the state unsafe to the community While Zuckerberg is thrown into the briar patch of facing dire consequences if he ever again treats conservatives equally  we are apparently supposed to forget that he owns nearly half of the public square  controls much of the means through which we now communicate  and uses phony far left fact checkers and Kafka esque rules to de platform  silence  intimidate  and marginalize ideas and thought  coming from half the country YouTube is doing the same  as is Twitter Thirty five years ago  Ma Bell and the U S  Post Office enjoyed a similar vertical monopoly over the way America communicated  But as long as we did not break any of the laws written by those we elected  as opposed to arbitrary community standards written by corporate overlords  we could express ourselves freely in whatever way we chose  Neither Ma Bell not the U S  Mail monitored our communications  and as a result  Ma Bell never banned anyone from using its service over an opinion that offended the phone company Compare that to todays tech fascists  those who lured us on to their platforms with the promise of free and unfettered speech  and then  once that market was captured  the trap was sprung with rules designed to silence and marginalize the political right And that is only the half of it Last week Kevin Williamson was fired from the Atlantic over an unacceptable abortion opinion  Meanwhile  Ta Nehisi Coates continues to enjoy his job  as he should  at that same publication even after describing as not quite human those first responders who sacrificed their own lives for others on September 11 Then there are the neverending boycotts ginned up through a gotcha campaigns launched by the organized left  It has almost become a daily occurrence to read about another cowardly or compliant corporation joining a jihad to silence someone on the right  oftentimes over opinions  jokes  or ideas  that came from the likes of Bill Clinton  Barack Obama  or Jon Stewart a decade or so ago Just last week  and simply for accusing media sacred cow David Hogg of whining  the left organized an advertiser boycott to destroy Laura Ingrahams television career  Around 10 or so corporations quickly chose to join this un American blacklist  That blacklisting campaign is ongoing Yes  the rioters and hecklers veto to silence right of center ideas that was once contained on the college campus is now everywhere and mainstreamed What decent people  true liberals  used to call McCarthyism  witch hunts  and blacklisting  are now blessed as progressive cures in the cause of not hurting anyones feelings Meanwhile  Joss Whedon  one of the biggest film directors in the world  can publicly call for President Trump to die  and go on about his life and career  as he should be allowed to do As far as the Second Amendment goes  the aforementioned Hogg is both sword and shield for a media desperate to disarm us  The 17 year old voluntarily stepped into the arena  has accused millions of NRA members of being pathetic fuckers that want to keep killing our children  but if we call him a whiner  we are slapped with a scarlet letter and wished into the cornfield The push to take our guns is 24 7 in the media  an unrelenting spectacle of lies  misinformation  ignorance  and mostly hate  The idea of repealing the Second Amendment is now openly discussed  not because there is a chance of that happening  but to smooth the way for a de facto repeal when the left enjoys a 5 4 majority on the Supreme Court Never forget Heller And guns is yet another arena where cowardly and compliant corporations are hindering our God given rights  with a form of corporate gun control that  among other things  refuses to sell to anyone under 21 or simply refuses to business with gun hobbyists or the NRA  The media hails these corporations choosing who they will do business with even as they hail the States persecution of cake and floral artists who do not wish to violate their religious conscience by participating in a same sex marriage On Monday afternoon we learned that another Amendment is not so sacred anymore  the Fourth With the unprecedented home and office raid of President Trumps personal attorney Michael Cohen  special counsel Robert Mueller has gone so far as to seize the communications between attorney and client  between Trump and Cohen  a flagrant violation of the Fourth Amendment  But what do we see in our media  A fear of prosecutorial overreach  A fear of the precedent this might set  No  only media cheerleading due to the fact that their desire to criminalize politics is coming closer to fruition  that they can still hold on to the hope of a Deep State coup that will overturn an entire presidential election Be sure to read Seftons full piece Follow John Nolte on Twitter  NolteNC  Follow his Facebook Page here ,0
Ingrahams crime was to accuse Hogg of whining about not being accepted into four University of California schools But another Fox News host did something far worse Geraldo Rivera  one of the networks more liberal personalities  saidMar  30 that his one regret as a journalist was not supporting the Palestinians during the secondIntifada  which lasted roughly from 2000 to 2005 I regret in 2002 backing down from backing the Palestinians in their conflict with Israel  The Second Intifada  Because I saw with my own eyes how  And I know how this is going to resonate very poorly with the people watching right now  But still  I have to tell you how I feel  I saw at firsthand how those people were  And now you said 14  15 people killed in Gaza  Palestinians killed by the IDF forces  I saw what an awful life they live under constant occupation and oppression And people keep saying  Oh  they are terrorists  Or they are this or they are that  They are an occupied people and I regret chickening out after 2002 and not staying on that story and adding my voice as a Jew  adding my voice to those counseling a two state solution  It is so easy to put them out of sight  out of mind  And let them rot  And be killed  And keep this thing festering  And I think a lot of our current problems stem from  thats almost our original sin  Palestine and Israel  I want a two state solution  I want President Trump to re energize the peace process The secondintifada was launched in September 2000 by the Palestinian Authority after then Chairman Yasser Arafat walked away from a peace deal at Camp David in July of that year The uprising was much deadlier than the firstintifada of the late 1980s  and included a massive terrorist campaign of suicide bombings and other attacks against Israeli civilians  Some 1 100 Israelis were killed Geraldo did not mention any of that  Rather  he sent the message that Palestinian terror can always be excused by an occupation that  arguably  continues largely because of their own intransigence   Israelis withdrew all soldiers and civilians from the occupied Gaza Strip in 2005  and suffered thousands of rockets and mortars in response Last week  the Zionist Organization of America demanded that Fox News fire Geraldo  Fox should not continue to employ a commentator who has stated his support for the wholesale mass murder and injury of thousands of Jews  and who turns truth upside down  blaming the victims and exonerating the terrorists  said ZOA president Morton A  Klein in a press release What was striking about the ZOAs response is that it was virtually the only reaction  The concerned activists and corporate citizens who could not stand to be associated with a Fox News host who merely poked fun at a teenage gun control enthusiast failed to muster the same outrage against a host who had apparently condoned terrorism That is not to say Geraldo should be fired  though he should be criticized and challenged  It does  however  show the double standards of the left  and reveals that what lies behind the campaign against Ingraham is pure politics Joel B  Pollak is Senior Editor at Large at Breitbart News  He was named to Forwards 50 most influential Jews in 2017  He is the co author ofHow Trump Won  The Inside Story of a Revolution  which is available from Regnery  Follow him on Twitter at  joelpollak ,0
Hogg has emerged as one of the more obnoxious gun control activists among the survivors of last months mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland  Florida  He hasaccused the National Rifle Association  NRA  of being money grubbing child murderers  to cite just one example among many So when news emerged that Hogg had been rejected from four University of California

gesture  even if accompanied  perhaps  by some amount of advertising pressure and management arm twisting It was also a golden opportunity for Hogg to show magnanimity  Had he accepted her apology and invitation  Hogg could have seized the moral high ground  and rallied the country to his cause Instead  Hogg rejected her apology  tweeting that Ingraham had just wanted to save  her  advertisers  He then exploited the apology  daring her to denounce her networks coverage of the students  which has actually  at times  been obsequious in its empathy Having attacked Ingraham  Hogg hid behind false piety  and his youth  Its time to love thy neighbor  not mudsling at children  he said I 100  agree an apology in an effort just to save your advertisers is not enough  I will only accept your apology only if you denounce the way your network has treated my friends and I in this fight  Its time to love thy neighbor  not mudsling at children  https t co H0yWs4zMGk  David Hogg  davidhogg111  March 29

was a strategic blunder by Hogg  the latest in series of mistakes by the gun control movement after last Saturdays nationwide marches  the worst of which was a New York Timesop ed by former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens calling for the Second Amendment to be repealed   If Republicans needed a way to rouse their voter base from complacency in the midterm elections  that was it But more than a political mistake  Hoggs rejection of Ingrahams apology revealed the disturbing folly of the idea of entrusting these children with national leadership Hogg and his classmates are using their power to attack the fundamental legal and moral architecture of our society  not just the Second Amendment  but also the First  He would rather destroy Ingrahams platform than use it for his own purposes And all the while  Hogg cloaks himself in the language of tolerance   D o not attack each other talk to one another  this applies to me too  he said several weeks ago in a tweet he pinned to his profile  and evidently forgot Can we please not debate this as Democrats and Republicans but discuss this as Americans  In the comments if you see someone you dissagree with do not attack each other talk to one another  this applies to me too  WE MUST WORK TOGETHER TO SAVE OUR FUTURE  David Hogg  davidhogg111  March 12  2018 The boycotters claim that they are not violating the First Amendment  They point out that the Amendment only applies to the government  not to private corporations After years of complaining about  and campaigning against  the Supreme Courts decision inCitizens United  the left has suddenly decided that corporations have free speech rights But they know they are violating the spirit of the First Amendment  and the ideal of the open society They do not care  In their view  the ends justify the means And the goal  they say  is to save the lives of children  Anyone opposing that goal either wants children to die  or is indifferent to their murder The charge makes any kind of debate  on the rare occasion an opposing view is actually allowed  almost impossible The atmosphere that Hogg and his fellow activists brings to mind William Goldings novelLord of the Flies  The story there was also about a group of children survivors In the aftermath of shared trauma  some of the boys try to re establish the rules of civilization  basic things  like allowing each person to speak  one at a time  while holding a conch shell The others  finding themselves suddenly without grownups around  revel in the destructive exercise of savage power for its own sake The grownups guiding  and funding  Hogg and his classmates seem to have failed to impart one of the basic rules of Judeo Christian society  which is the importance of forgiveness Without it  as Hannah Arendt observed inThe Human Condition  our society becomes trapped in a cycle of unintended harms In abusing their newfound power  Hogg and company are tugging at the threads of our civilization  unraveling the social fabric that holds us together  exacerbating our common  but divided  pain Joel B  Pollak is Senior Editor at Large at Breitbart News  He was named to Forwards 50

And then Ker splat Saturdays attendance at the anti gun march was  to say the least  quite underwhelming  especially when you consider all the energy our unbiased  objective media spent advertising it  The fallout from the march was even worse On Sunday  the super hyped 60 Minutes interview with Stormy Daniels fizzled  landed with such a dud that is all anyone talked about Monday  The 21 million viewers might have delivered the newsmagazine its best night in a decade  but it was still way less than half of the 49 million who tuned in to see Monica Lewinskys 1999 interview Also on Monday came a huge bump for Trumps job approval rating and A near record day for the stock market To add insult to injury  last week  between the medias porn porn porn gungrab gungrab gungrab  they told us that President McStupidCrazyRacist had just launched a disastrous trade war and the apocalypse what nigh And then this and this happened Oh  and all the polls taken during the Stormy era show the Republican Party in much better shape to house the House Oops The CNN ization of the entire news media  this Zucker ification against Trump that focuses only on nonsense and left wing activism  has failed so hard  some within the media are actually wondering if the media should not focus more  say  issues the public actually cares about Amy Walter of the Cook Report tweeted Tuesday  One reason

https t co tjAXLcs486  Josh Kraushaar  HotlineJosh  March 27  2018 Even the far left Hollywood Reporter published a long lament The other night  I succumbed to temptation  I lapped up every second of60 Minutes Stormy Daniels interview  just like20 millionAmericans and countless others around the world  My only regret was that there wasnt more  which might explain why the ratings dropped off so precipitously  Once Daniels had made her exit  who needed to keep watching  The show started with a climax  so to speak  and went down from there I left the program feeling deflated  But it wasnt because the interview disappointed  It was because Id bought into the argument that it mattered in the first place  that everything to do with Daniels is Real News Real News is whats going on in Syria and Yemen and Saudi Arabia and Iran  Real News is the hundreds of thousands of students who demonstrated in favor of gun control  Real News is the horror that 700 000 plus DACA kids may face if the government deports them  Real News is a budget that was just passed  with such token coverage by the broadcast media that I couldnt even tell you what was in it Behind the scenes in MediaBubbleLand  there is no doubt that many Media Provincials are privately licking wounds and wondering the same But does anyone think we would see all this second guessing and sudden concern over The Issues That Matter To The American People if this weekend had not spectacularly backfired  had Trumps approval rating done what the far left CNN was expecting  dropped seven points to 28 percent as opposed to climbing eight points to 43 percent Our disgraced media seem to have forgotten four things 1  The impossible to shame medias partisan hypocrisy on the issue of personal matters  Former President Bill Clinton was all about extra marital affairs  even while president in the Oval Office  The media protected him  and protected him even more when he was credibly accused of harassment  Paula Jones won a judgment and  850 000  groping  by a Democrat  and even rape But now the media are freaking out because a man who has never presented himself as our moral savior might have had two consensual affairs 12 freakin years ago Please 2  When the Republican Party went hard after Clinton over his private life  his job approval numbers also improved  The public does not like what they see as politically motivated moral witch hunts 3  Its the economy  you stupes  While the media try to create a moral panic over something as dumb as a consensual boink 12 years ago  as the medias wild eyed conspiracy theories about Russian collusion collapse into a pile of Obama FBI scandals  Trump has kept his eye on the ball  has done his job  and now his economy has inspired confidence  real job growth  and economic growth 4  CNN is a last place ratings catastrophe and a national laughingstock  Why would any sane news outlet follow the lead of a proven failure The good news is that there is no coming back for the media  As a moral authority  as a swayer of public opinion  the institution is deceased through an act of credibility suicide Follow John Nolte on Twitter  NolteNC  Follow his Facebook

This year  days after Ryan successfully prioritized tax cuts ahead of President Trumps popular immigration reduction agenda  the Koch brothers donated about half a million to Ryans campaign committee Ryans brand of Republicanism is reliant on pushing unpopular tax and entitlement reform agendas  as when  in 2016  the House Speaker told American workers that tax cuts  not penalties for multinational corporations  were necessary to stop the massive outsourcing of U S  jobs to third world nations The Koch brothers  staunch advocates of mass immigration  geared up alongside Ryans tax cuts and the two have marched in lockstep together opposing Trumps populist fair trade agenda  where he has placed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports  as well as on Chinese imports  to help rebuild Americas depleted manufacturing base Charles Koch most recently said that he and his brothers network of organizations were working hard against Trumps trade agenda Were working hard against all these other protectionist trade barriersthat are just different forms of corporate welfare which  other than a few special interests  will make Americans worse off  Koch said Ryan  like the Koch brothers  came out of the gate opposing Trumps fair trade agenda  denouncing the plan by saying he was extremely worried about a mainstream media hyped trade war Wisconsin voters  Ryans constituents  have been opposed to the House Speakers free trade asreligion  with a majority telling pollsters in 2016 that free trade was responsible for taking U S  jobs away from them  The poll revealed that only 33 percent of Republican voters said free trade creates jobs in the U S President Barack Obama shakes hands with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan  R  as Vice President Joe Biden looks on before the State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill January 12  2016 in Washington  D C  In his final State of the Union  President Obama is expected to reflect on the past seven years in office and speak on topics including climate change  gun control  immigration and income inequality   Photo by Evan Vucci  Pool Getty Images Meanwhile  Ryan has credited his tax cuts for Trumps economic success  Republican voters  though  have repeatedly said that tax reform is not a priority for them  The biggest priority for GOP voters  month after month  Reducing immigration  an initiativesupported by Trump but opposed by Ryan and the Koch brothers In the latest Harvard Harris poll  42 percent of Republican voters said immigration was the most important issue facing the country  The same amount of Republicans said national security  too  is the most important issue Meanwhile  only 25 percent of Republican voters said the national debt was the biggest issue in the country  while only 12 percent of Republicans said the same of taxes Reducing immigration was a bigger priority for GOP voters than tax cuts  repealing Obamacare  getting the U S  out of the Iran Deal  destroying ISIS  and expanding familyleave Immigration is so important to Republicans that it even surpasses the economy and jobs as being the biggest issue Supporters of President Trumps sayreducing immigration should be thesecond biggest priority for the White House  just after stimulating American jobs Nonetheless  the Koch brothers have remained opposed to cutting the current inflow of low skilled foreign nationals to the country  where more than 1 5 million illegal and legal immigrants enter the U S  every year Ryan  too  has opposed cutting legal immigration levels  favoring the Washington  D C imposed cheap labor economic model where businesses import foreign workers to compete with American workers at low wages The opposition to reducing legal immigration  though  is not in line with Ryans constituents views on immigration  For example  most recent polling shows that a plurality of Wisconsin voters wants legal immigration cut in at least half Even in Ryans retirement announcement  he did not mention any plans for the Republican controlled House to push Trumps popular agenda of immigration reduction  Instead  Ryan said he would keep at it on trying to cut entitlements for Americans as foreigners continue pouring into the country Paul Ryan just doubled down on cutting Medicaid  Medicare and Social Security   The House passed the biggest entitlement reform bill Congress has ever considered last year  so we're just going to have to keep at it on entitlements  pic twitter com Vo08lHtcsv  Jeremy Slevin  jeremyslevin  March 20  2018 With Ryans agenda to push entitlement reform just ahead of the 2018 midterm elections  the Koch brothers are investing up to  400 million in trying to get globalist friendly GOP candidates elected to Congress who will vote to continue mass immigration to the U S  About  20 million of the Koch funding will go towards selling Ryans tax reform Ryans tax cuts  while getting more money back in the pockets of Americans  does not have a lasting impact on voters  Last month  50 percent of swing voters told pollsters that the tax reform legislation would have no impact on their decision as to whom to vote for  Immigration  for swing voters  remains more important to their midterm election vote than tax reform Still  Ryans control of the House has put the Trump administration in a bind when it comes to pushing their popular immigration reform agenda  which not only includes reducing immigration  but building a wall along the U S Mexico border and ending the Diversity Visa Lottery program which imports 50 000 random foreign nationals every year In the most recent spending bill  signed by Trump  Ryan worked with Democrats to expand the number of low wage foreign workers entering the U S  for the big business lobby  The spending bill also did not include any border wallfunding increasedthe Catch and Release program that allows illegal aliens to be released into the interior of the U S  and didnot addany new deportation agents to help deport illegal aliens living across America Trump  though he signed the spending bill  called it a ridiculous situation  a blow to Ryans speakership The Koch brothersbiggest critique of the spending bill  unsurprisingly  was that it did not include amnesty for illegal aliens John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News  Follow him on Twitter at

The attack to which Boot refers is Russias 2016 election meddling as alleged in Special Counsel Robert Muellers indictment of 13 Russian nationals last week  Boot suggests President Trumps reaction to the allegations  and the nearly 15 month media driven frenzy over Russian meddling that preceded them is equivalent to a president ignoring the September 11  200  attacks by Islamist terrorists that killed almost 3 000 Americans Imagine if  after 9 11  the president had said that the World Trade Center and Pentagon could have been attacked by China or lots of other people  Boot writes  Imagine if he had dismissed claims of al Qaidas responsibility as a hoax and said that he really believed Osama bin Ladens denials The Russian scheme  with apparent links to the Russian government  is alleged to have set up social media accounts and organized street level activism to spread discord in the 2016 election cycle at various times  supporting eventual winner Donald Trump as well as fomenting opposition to him after his victory Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein emphasized that the indictment makes no allegation the election outcome was affected Boot acknowledges that Russias attack did not leave anyone dead but implies a rough equivalence to the events of 9 11  explicitly describing Russia social media scheming as the second worst foreign attack on America in the past two decades  The Russian subversion of the 2016 election did not  to be sure  kill nearly 3 000 people  But its longer term impact may be even more corrosive by undermining faith in our democracy  Boot explains The Boston Marathon bombing  the San Bernardino massacre  and the Pulse Nightclub shooting  all deadly attacks committed in the name of or inspired by foreign jihadist organizations  pale in comparison by Boots estimation Boot further claims Trumps response  denying the collusion between his campaign and the Russians of which no credible accusation has been made to this day  is obstructionism preventing the kind of commission that was set up after 9 11 and which Boot believes is needed to respond to Russia propaganda efforts  He argues The presidents obstructionism makes it impossible to appoint an 11 8 Commission to study this cyber assault and to recommend responses  Various agencies  such as the FBI  are trying to combat the Russians on their own  but there is no coordinated response Boot also appears to call for government regulation of the internet as a remedy to Russian efforts  Just as Sept  11 made clear that private security could not safeguard the aviation system  so the 2016 Russian attack made clear that social media companies cannot safeguard the electoral system  he writes  A greater federal role is needed  yet Trump refuses to even admit that the problem exists Since being hired on January 30 as the Washington Posts new ostensibly conservative columnist  Boot has added support for broad new gun control measures and a rethink of the Second Amendment  continued mass immigration  and censuring House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes  R CA  to his previously confirmed positions in favor of legal abortion and transgender peoples use of public facilities that do not correspond to their sex  his embrace of the leftist doctrine of white privilege  and his admonition that the GOP deserves to die ,0

The new omnibus spending bill is a wretched monument to the Swamp  a time capsule of government waste and broken promises that future generations will unearth when they want to understand how they were saddled with mountains of debt they have no hope of repaying House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi  D CA  gloated Wednesday evening that the bill does not fund the border wall  only fencing that was already authorized under current law Yes  there are a few good things  like expanded defense spending and the Taylor Force Act to defund Palestinian terrorism  But it virtually guarantees a return to trillion dollar deficits  It also funds Planned Parenthood and even makesconcessions on gun control Sen  Rand Paul  R KY  seems to be the only one who is actually reading the bill  and is tweeting its craziest provisions  such as  10 million for disadvantaged Egyptian students  my favorite Nick Mulvaney  the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget  pushed back against the idea that Republicans had failed despite controlling all of the branches of the federal government  He argued that since Republicans only hold 51 seats  nine short of the 60 needed to break a filibuster under Senate rules  the GOP really co governs with the Democratic Party and must therefore obtain the oppositions assent to pass most legislation Technically  that is true  But it is also absurd By that standard  Republicans have not controlled the Senate for nearly a century   The last time Republicans enjoyed a filibuster proof majority was in the 67th Congress  from 1921 23  Democrats last held that power in 2009 10  and also held it several times in the 1930s and postwar era Mulvaney suggested that the only way for Republicans to achieve what they want is to change the rules of the Senate  something that President Donald Trump wants to do  but which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  R KY  will not  and for good reason  Democrats would eagerly abuse that power at the first chance  Alternatively  Republicans could win 60 Senate seats at the polls  not impossible  but looking harder than it did a year ago All of that misses the point  Republicans do not need total control of the Senate to achieve better outcomes in budget negotiations  They simply need backbone  and stronger leadership  The simple reason that Republicans capitulate to most Democratic demands on spending is that Republicans are still afraid that they will be blamed by the mainstream media for any government shutdown that results from the failure to reach an agreement in time Republicans continue to believe that  even though Democrats bore the brunt of the blame for the last shutdown  earlier this year  Perhaps that is why Democrats did not insist on protection for the so called Dreamers in the omnibus spending bill  despite heavy pressure from amnesty groups and the partys progressive base  But at least Democrats went to the wall for a core constituency  Republicans will not defend even their most basic promises No one expects Republicans to get everything they want  But the point of having the majority in both houses is being able to getmostof what they want  Mulvaney and Republican leaders in Congress describe the agreements they reach as the only possible deals under the circumstances  But in fact there are other deals that Democrats might also accept  deals more favorable to Republican priorities  if the governing party properly used its leverage Here is how it ought to be done  and how itis actually done  when Democrats are in power  1  Pass a budget in the House that represents a general consensus within the ruling party  2  Take that budget to the Senate and dare the minority party to filibuster  3  Let the government shut down  and blame the opposition  4  Wait for the minority party to fold  or make a token concession to the opposition that allows it to save face  and re open the government Somehow Republicans seem unwilling  or unable  to govern  Yes  they passed more defense spending  one of the only compromises Democrats allowed  But they failed to fund the wall  a core promise from 2016  They also failed to cut federal spending and move toward a balanced budget  as promised in every election since 2010 As a result  the Republicans are losing the confidence of their own voters  Nothing Democrats could do is as damaging as that Joel B  Pollak is Senior Editor at Large at Breitbart News  He was named to Forwards 50 most influential Jews in 2017  He is the co author ofHow Trump Won  The Inside Story of a Revolution  which is available from Regnery  Follow him on Twitter at  joelpollak ,0
As the Huffington Post put it  American Schools Are STILL Racist  Government Report Finds  The evidence  Five percent of white students were suspended annually  compared with 16 percent of black students  according to the report  Q E D   According to theory  theres NO WAY blacks and Hispanics are doing things that require more school discipline than whites or Asians  So if more black students are expelled than Asians  well  gentlemen  we have our proof of racism  To comply  schools would have to stop suspending black kids for breaking a teachers jaw  but suspend Asians for dropping an eraser   Using the same logic  I could close the achievement gap between blacks and Asians in a single day by going to every principals office in the country and burning the transcripts   Liberals are saying  You know  thats not a bad idea   The school to prison pipeline argument for racial quotas in discipline was hatched in education schools and black studies departments  What I want to know is  How did they test the idea   To validate the theory that recording students criminal behavior produces students with criminal records  we divided students into two groups  Group A we continued to suspend when they acted up  Group B we would not suspend no matter what  even when they engaged in their little mischief  like cracking heads with crowbars  dropping teachers off buildings  using a switchblade to cut other students eyes out RESULT  At the end of the year  Group B had better records   Were the researchers really in suspense about how the experiment was going to turn out  I could have told them at the beginning that their odds of success were tremendous  unless they forgot halfway through and began accidentally suspending students in Group B   But the Obama administration said  Wow  Thats amazing  Do you think other schools could replicate those results   One of the administrations models was Broward County  Florida  Which is kind of important  now that we know that it was Browards official policy to make it impossible to arrest students like Nikolas Cruz  thus allowing him to amass a cache of firearms  walk into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and murder 17 people   The school to prison pipeline nonsense may not be the explanation for every school shooting  but it is absolutely the explanation for THIS school shooting  No matter what Cruz did  no matter how many times his crimes were reported to the sheriff or school officials  there was no way a lad with a name like Nikolas Cruz was ever going to leave school with a record   Broward Countys innovative idea of eliminating school discipline captivated Obamas Department of Education  It was expressly cited by the departments Civil Rights Division with the notation  New model for other jurisdictions   Last October  nearly a year into the Trump administration  Broward Schools Superintendent Robert W  Runcie humbly noted that the district was receiving invitations from around the country  including from The White House and Federal Office of Civil Rights  to share details about the historic reforms on school discipline   Either  Liberals truly believe that all races commit crimes at exactly the same level  frequency and intensity  OR they are willing to have people die for their political agenda   Conservatives didnt pick this school shooting as the test case for gun control  It was liberals who were going to ride the Parkland shooting all the way to the midterms  They thought they had a beautiful story about the evil NRA   Not the mass shooting in Orlando  because of the obvious immigration angle  Not San Bernardino  for the same reason  Not Las Vegas  probably for the same reason  but well never know because law enforcement has issued only lies and nonsense about that shooting   The media did all the hard work of making sure Parkland was the only topic on anyones mind  with everyone demanding that we do something   And then we got the facts  Cruzs criminal acts were intentionally ignored by law enforcement on account of Browards much celebrated school to prison pipeline reforms   Thank God for the internet  or wed never have known the truth   Admittedly  most of the harm done by the policy that enabled Cruz is not usually a mass shooting  The main damage done by the school to prison pipeline idiocy is  broken bones  smashed teeth  traumatized students  making it impossible for other students to learn  having a bad influence on marginal students and teachers sinking into depression   Check at your local school for the full results  Thanks to the Obama administration  this crackpot theory is sweeping school districts across the nation   The next time Democrats control Congress and the presidency  we will have racial quotas for prisons  too  When that happens  you better hope the government hasnt taken your guns   COPYRIGHT 2018 ANN COULTER  DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION ,0
Loudon challenged calls for denying Second Amendment rights to people deemed to be in poor mental health  warning that such a move would empower the federal government to broadly define mental impairment About 70 percent of us are  are diagnosable by the Diagnostics and Statistical Manual  said Loudon  Seventy percent of us are diagnosable with a mental issue  Which government agency do you want to audit your mental health and get to decide whether or not you and your child ever get to have your Second Amendment rights Mansour quipped that Democrats will seek to define conservatives as mentally ill   If we let the government decide whos crazy and whos not  the minute the Democrats take over the White House  theyll be carting off Breitbart writers left and right  You need to be re educated right now ' joked Mansour  I dont want to give the government that control because theyll be labeling all sorts of people as crazy that are not crazy The vast majority of psychologists  said Loudon  are leftists  We know that  over  90 percent of  academics  are very left of center  and thats who the psychologists and masters degree therapists are in the world  very  very leftist The use of minors by Democrats and their news media allies as political human shields in pursuit of agitation against the Second Amendment is exploitative  said Loudon It is despicable the way the Democrats are preying on children and exploiting children  said Loudon  And the reason theyre doing it  they did it to illegal immigrants with DACA recipients  Theyre doing it now to these children  Why  Because they cant get the American adults in this country to vote for them Teenagers cognitive development is typically much poorer than fully developed adults  said Loudon  As such  they should not be entrusted with setting public policy Our brains arent really emotionally mature  as teenagers  especially the emotional center of our brains  said Loudon  Our brains arent fully formed until our young twenties  sometimes even a little into our mid to late twenties  So we cant expect children to make decisions about whats best for children  The adults need to adult here  They shouldve protected them in the first place  and they should be handling it now and not handing it over or giving microphones to children as if theyre going to make the same sort of non emotional and non reactionary decisions that adults make  Its just not a fact  and I think it needs to be addressed  and I think everybodys afraid to say it The left politically weaponizes guilt via the use of victims of tragedy as political human shields  said Mansour When I was looking at what I call the childrens crusade for gun control  I think this is exactly what the left always does  said Mansour  They use the victims of some tragedy as a way to push for legislation or a legislative agenda that is unpopular and would never win at the ballot box  that people dont want  and they basically try to use the victims  Its almost like a shield  and then  they try to push for this thing and then guilt all the rest of us to make us feel guilty if we dont acquiesce to whatever the victim is asking for because we feel bad  We feel terrible for these children  the trauma that they went through  and  of course  we want to protect our kids  and  of course  we have an admiration for the innocence  exuberance and the optimism of youth  but come on  were talking about a fundamental American right that our Founders made as our Second Amendment that was crucial to their understanding of liberty because of the way our country was founded and the way that our revolution started  and were going to cede this over to children who just went through this traumatic event Breitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXMs Patriot channel 125 from 9 00 p m  to midnight Eastern  6 00 p m  to 9 00 p m  Pacific LISTEN Follow Robert Kraychik on Twitter rkraychik ,0
12 45 a m Congress has approved a  1 3 trillion measure bestowing hefty increases on military and domestic programs  It gives President Donald Trump just a nibble of the money hes wanted to build his wall with Mexico The Senate gave final passage to the bipartisan legislation by 65 32 early Friday  The House approved it 256 167 hours earlier Trump is expected to sign the bill before Saturday  That would avert what would be a third government shutdown this election year  which would embarrass Republicans controlling the White House and Congress Trump initially promised Mexico would pay to construct his big  beautiful wall  That country has refused  and Trump has sought  25 billion for the project and other border security efforts This bill provides only  1 6 billion for a years work 12 21 a m A  1 3 trillion spending bill has cleared a crucial hurdle in the Senate  That vote has cleared the way for final passage of the measure  which would provide big spending boosts to defense and domestic programs The House approved the legislation Thursday afternoon  After hours of delays  the Senate voted 67 30 to topple procedural hurdles to passage  seven votes more than the 60 that were needed President Donald Trump is expected to sign the legislation Had Congress not approved the bill by midnight Friday night  there would have been a government shutdown for the third time this election year  That would have been an embarrassment to Republicans  who control the White House and Congress 11 40 p m A fresh obstacle  whether to rename a national forest in Idaho  has been tossed in front of the mammoth spending bill Congress is trying to finish Idaho Republican Sen  James Risch has objected to a provision in the 2 232 page bill that would rename a forest in his home state for Cecil Andrus  Andrus was a four term Democratic governor who died last year Aides and lawmakers from both parties say Risch is delaying Senate approval of the  1 3 trillion spending bill unless the forest isnt renamed In response  the Senate passed language halting the renaming effort  That provision would require passage by the House  which has left town for a recess Senate leaders are talking to Risch  hoping to resolve the issue and free the spending bill 1 17 p m A budget bill passed by the House does not include money for work to develop and build a nuclear waste dump outside Las Vegas President Donald Trump has proposed reviving a long stalled nuclear waste repository at Nevadas Yucca Mountain  100 miles from Las Vegas  The states Republican governor and Nevada lawmakers from both parties oppose the plan Republican Sen  Dean Heller  who faces a tough re election this fall  pushed to exclude funding for Yucca from the massive spending bill  as did Democratic Sen  Catherine Cortez Masto A spokesman for Cortez Masto says she was pleased that Congress has recognized this boondoggle for what it is  Spokesman Ryan King adds that Cortez Masto will continue to fight like hell to make sure any efforts to revive Yucca Mountain in Congress are blocked 1 01 p m The House has easily approved a bipartisan  1 3 trillion measure handing huge spending increases to defense programs and domestic initiatives ranging from road building to biomedical research Thursdays vote was 256 167  That shipped the 2 232 page package to the Senate Passage there is assured  But some Republican senators upset that the measure spends too much could delay the bill  The question is whether it will be approved before midnight Friday night If it isnt  that would force the years third government shutdown  That would likely be brief  but still embarrass Republicans controlling the White House and Congress The bill provides just  1 6 billion to start building pieces of President Donald Trumps wall with Mexico and for other border security steps  But it doesnt temporarily extend protections against deportation for young Dreamer immigrants 12 44 p m The White House says President Donald Trump will sign a  1 3 trillion budget bill that boosts military spending  but does not include all the funding he sought for his promised border wall White House officials say the plan includes key administration priorities  particularly defense spending  They argue they could not get everything they want because Democratic votes are needed in the closely divided Senate Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said the bill was not perfect  but thats not how the process works He noted the deal includes at least some money for new construction along the border Trump sounded less than enthused by the bill Wednesday night  He tweeted  Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment 10 55 a m A sweeping  1 3 trillion budget bill that substantially boosts military and domestic spending but leaves behind young immigrant Dreamers has cleared a procedural hurdle The Republican controlled House narrowly approved a measure allowing the bill to go forward as lawmakers struggle to meet a Friday night deadline to fund the government or face a federal shutdown The bill negotiated by congressional leaders deprives President Donald Trump some of his border wall money and takes only incremental steps to address gun violence Although some conservative Republicans balked at the size of the spending increases and the rush to pass the bill  the White House says the president backs the legislation The 2 232 page text was made public Wednesday night  Democrats say lawmakers had little time to read the bill before voting 12 14 a m Congressional leaders hope to start voting as soon as Thursday on a sweeping  1 3 trillion budget bill that substantially boosts military and domestic spending A stopgap measure may be needed to ensure federal offices arent hit with a partial shutdown at midnight Friday when funding for the government expires The bill keeps the government operating but leaves behind young immigrant Dreamers  deprives

Speaker Ryan announced on Wednesday that he will retire at the end of this congressional term in January 2019 Ryan touted his legislative victories as leader of the House during a press conference on Wednesday  namely tax cuts and increased funding for the military  Ryan argued I am really proud of what we have been able to do  We passed the first major reform of our tax code for the first time in 36 years  which has already been a huge success for our country  Second  is to rebuild our nations military  This will make our country more prosperous and more secure I think we have achieved a heck of a lot  Ryan added However  he failed to include other legislative initiatives that failed  including failure to repeal Obamacare  fund the wall  and pass pro American immigration reform Here is a list of Speaker Paul Ryans top legislative failures BUNGLING OBAMACARE REPEAL  Speaker Paul Ryan bungled Obamacare repeal  Republicans gained historic majorities in the House and Senate based upon their promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act Speaker Ryan and the rest of House Republican leadership drafted the Republicans original Obamacare repeal bill  the American Health Care Act  AHCA  in secret  When the Republican leadership revealed the bill  conservatives and populists revolted against it  believing that the bill did not do enough to repeal Obamacare  Pundits dubbed the original bill  RyanCare  and Obamacare Lite Ryan had to pull the vote on the RyanCare bill at the last minute in March 2017  believing that the bill did not have enough conservative support to pass House Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep  Mark Meadows  R NC  stepped up and brokered a revised version of the bill  known as theMacArthur amendment  along with Tuesday Group co chairman Rep  Tom MacArthur  R NJ  The addition of the amendment collected enough Republican votes to pass the bill Meadows efforts in no small part seemed to have succeeded where Ryan failed  rallying his House Republican colleagues behind a years long campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacaredespite the fact that this bill does not constitute a full repeal of the previous presidents signature law With the help of Vice President Mike Pence  Republicans were able to garner enough votes in the House in May to pass a revised American Health Care Act  Obamacare repeal ultimately failed in the Senate on multiple occasions  largely due to the opposition of Sens  John McCain  R AZ  Susan Collins  R ME  and Lisa Murkowski  R AK PASSING A  1 3 TRILLION  2 322 PAGE OMNIBUS SPENDING BILL Speaker Ryan  along with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  R KY  and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer  D NY  passed a  1 3 trillion  2 232 page omnibus spending bill last March Republican leadership gave lawmakers less than 17 hours to read the bill before voting on the  1 3 trillion spending bill House Freedom Caucus Chairman Meadowslamentedin an interview withBreitbart News Dailyon Tuesday that theSenate Democrats seem to be calling most of the shots As Breitbart News reported  the omnibus spending bill contains language that explicitly bars funding for a southern border wall  although the bill did not include a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  DACA  illegal alien amnesty The omnibus alsocontainsprovisions that expand the H 2B visa worker program  which would reduce market pressure on companies to offer American workers higher wages Republican leadership alsoincludedprovisions that will allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  to conduct gun research  And the omnibus includes the Fix NICS Act  which would allow unelected bureaucrats to remove Americans right to purchase firearms without due process The omnibus spending bill includes funding for the New York Gateway Bridge project that will benefit Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer  D NY The House Freedom Caucus argued that the bill outright rejects the promises conservatives made to the voters Schumer declared victory after the omnibus passed  saying  Were able to accomplish more in the minority IGNORING BORDER WALL FUNDING AND IMMIGRATION REFORM The 2018 omnibus spending bill includes funding for roughly 33 miles of new border fence and denies funding for President Trumps preferred border walls  As Breitbart News noted in March  Congress could have funded the southern border wall for less than two percent of total omnibus spending Speaker Ryan has also opposed cutting legal immigration levels  calling them  arbitrary I just think arbitrary cuts to legal immigration dont take into effect the economys needs as the boomers are retiring  Ryan told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on last August  With babyboomers leaving the workforce  were still going to have labor shortages in certain areas and that is where a well reformed legal immigration system should be able to make up the difference A recent Harvard Harris poll suggested that 42 percent of GOP voters felt that immigration was the most important issue facing the country  more than Republican passed tax cut legislation and Obamacare repeal Chairman Meadows argued in a press conference in February that the current immigration debate is the defining moment for Paul Ryan  and that there would be consequences should he fail the American people The House GOP revealed in February that they have starting whipping votes for the Goodlatte Labrador bill  largely due to pressure from conservatives in the Freedom Caucus  The Goodlatte Labrador bill would end chain migration  the diversity visa lottery  catch and release  and build a wall on the southern border  President Trump endorsed the Goodlatte legislation in January Mark Meadows charged It is the defining moment for this Speaker  If he gets it wrong  it will have consequences for him but it will also have consequences for the Republican party  We cannot afford to miss the opportunity and do it right because we promised the American people we would do it right The House Freedom Caucus chairman declared This president was elected on largely an immigration platform that defined him differentlythan every other candidate and it is the defining moment more than the budget  or anything else that we passed ,0
In an email sent to Breitbart News  the parents  who wish to remain anonymous  argue the student walkout might appear to be a fairly innocuous First Amendment event to honor the students killed in the Parkland  Florida  shooting and to advocate for gun control However  the parents add  the decision involves issues concerning adherence to law and policy  the manipulation of minors  the misuse of tax dollars  and indoctrination and political activism during school hours They are especially concerned the student walkouts were organized by the Womens March  an anti Trump organization with ties to radical anti Semites such as Louis Farrakhan In an interview with Breitbart News  the parents attorney  Deborah Stevenson  with expertise in constitutional and education law  spoke about the parents issues with their school districts decision to allow students to participate in the walkout On March 12  Stevenson sent a letter to the New Milford Board of Education  superintendent Joshua D  Smith  and New Milford High School principal Greg P  Shugrue  which she made available to Breitbart News  Stevenson wrote My clients have asked me to notify you that this event violates state law  on the basis that state and local public funds are being used improperly to advocate for a political issue and to influence how voters will vote  Because it violates state law  we demand that the New Milford Public School Districts Superintendent and Board of Education immediately cancel the event  and rescind any association or prior involvement in it In addition to citing the Womens March Network or Womens March Youth Empower as an organizer of the student walkouts  Stevenson added that the event is promoted by the Action Network  which touts itself as an open platform that empowers individuals and groups to organize for progressive causes Thus  it is promoting the event for partisan political purposes  to influence voters to one side of an issue currently before members of the public  she wrote  This event is not simply a student initiated remembrance  It is an event aimed at engaging students in a political movement to affect change and to encourage them to vote for that change On Wednesday  Michael P  McKeon  attorney for the school district  wrote to Stevenson  in a reply that was made available to Breitbart News  that the school board has absolutely no connection with the Womens March Network and the Action Network To the extent that either group has referenced the New Milford Public Schools on their websites or in any other manner  that is neither at the behest of nor with the consent of the Board  McKeon argued  adding Furthermore  the mere fact that some outside organization unilaterally or in cooperation with some third party over whom the Board has no control lists  cites  or otherwise references the Board does not transform the Board into its agent or representative  nor does it impute to the Board any perspectives  philosophies  or political agendas such organization might have McKeon further asserted that  as Smith and Shugrue indicated in a letter to parents  Students at NMHS have indicated that they too want to make a statement and be a part of the movement In the letter  made available as well to Breitbart News  Smith and Shugrue wrote that the districts middle school students also expressed an interest in participating in the broader conversation  and would have a grade appropriate  optional opportunity that focuses on civic participation Clearly  this mornings activity is student initiated and student driven  McKeon said  dismissing all of the parents issues Stevenson  however  told Breitbart News that Connecticut  and likely many other states  has statutes pertaining to the use of taxpayer dollars to fund political protests  She said it defies logic how McKeon can make an argument that the walkout is not connected to a partisan or political issue Breitbart News asked whether school districts could be faced with further litigation if they do not allow students who wish to hold walkouts for other causes to do so Thats absolutely a valid concern  she said  There are equal protection laws as well  and if you are allowing one group to have free speech on your campus for a partisan purpose  then  obviously  its discriminatory not to allow an opposing point of view  So  it absolutely does open up the school districts to litigation and all sorts of other problems Stevenson said there are many ways allowing students to participate in a politically charged protest during school time harms students and the climate of the school itself Its one thing to teach civics and to teach history and to teach current events  Stevenson explained  But its another thing to encourage minors  whose maturity level is not that of an adult  to take a position one way or another Stevenson continued The idea of instruction in the schools I would think would be to assist students in critical thinking on both sides of an issue  If theyre going to be doing that  then that  I believe  would be in line with education  If they are simply instructing on one position  and one point of view  then I dont think that even the school districts or the boards of education running them would believe that that is appropriate Stevenson said the parents who have hired her also have a basic objection to their children being exploited or used because of an emotional issue  She explained Obviously  no one wants to have their children harmed  And it is a tragic event any time a child is harmed or killed  But  its more along the lines of media attention and using children  We have laws against exploiting children for any purpose  Its right in our Connecticut law and Im sure other states have similar laws  That is what the issue is for many parents Stevenson noted that Smith and Shugrue stated in their letter that For students who do not wish to participate in this movement  an alternate location will be provided You have the official position of a public school saying  We will allow these students to take this protest  we will encourage it  supervise it  facilitate it  and use taxpayer funds to do this  and those children who do not want to participate  Well  well have an alternative location for them to be  Stevenson asserted Now  if youre in that public school  and youre a child in that public school  what is the pressure on you to participate with those others who are going outside  or to be ostracized in an alternative location  and  then  perhaps bullied later  Why didnt you participate with our march  We were all out there  she explained  So  I think that creates a climate where children are endangered of being ostracized  alienated  and bullied unnecessarily  And this is something that is supported by the public school board and district staff Stevenson said the issues the parents have is a matter of the rule of law  She asked Are you going to collectively decide what the law is and follow it  or are you going to take a very emotional issue and take advantage of anyone  children or anyone  to advocate for your position on an issue  To take that kind of an emotional issue  and advocate  and not follow the law while youre doing it  and use taxpayer dollars to fund your decision to do that is just wrong Principal Shugrue did not immediately respond to Breitbart Newss request for comment on the parents concerns ,0

Tony Baker  Rep  Etsys former chief of staff  sent a threatening voicemail to Anna Kain  a former Etsy staffer whom Baker once dated  on May 5 You better fg reply to me or I will fg kill you  the message to Kain read  Kain subsequently alerted the police and secured a one year restraining order against Baker Etsy found out about the threat towards Kain within a week of the incident  according to emails obtained by theWashingtonPost  Instead of firing or suspending Baker  Etsy consulted her attorneys and advisers  Etsy also spoke with Kain on May 11  Kain revealed that Baker had punched  berated  and sexually harassed her in Etsys office throughout2014  while Kain worked as Etsys senior adviser Baker did not leave Etsys office for three months  On Bakers last day  August 12  Congresswoman Etsy wrote a positive recommendation letter Bakercould use to find future employment and also signed a legal document preventing her from disparaging him and discussing why he left  Baker eventually went to work for the Sandy Hook Promise  a gun control group created in the wake of the Sandy Hook school shooting  Baker was dismissed after thePostinquired about his employment at the group TheConnecticut Postfirst reported about Etsys handling of Bakers dismissal on Thursday In an interview on Monday  Etsy admitted that she did not handle the situation well  the Connecticutcongresswoman plans to reimburse the U S  Treasury the  5 000 Baker received in severance Etsy admitted What I did was not good enough and it didnt protect  my staff  enough        Im hopeful now with this conversation and this coming out that Ill be able to be much more direct and help other people in Congress understand the risks they are placing their staff at when they dont think they are Etsy also suggested that she was pressured by Office of House Employment Counsel  OHEC  to sign a non disclosure agreement  NDA  which helped delay Bakers dismissal  The ConnecticutDemocrat argued that she was working within a system that was designed to protect members and staffers who have misbehaved  not those who have been the target of harassment and assault Clearly thats what its all set up to do  to protect the member of Congress whose bad behavior caused the problem  Etsy argued Rep  Etsy added  It felt wrong to me        When Im reading the documents and these drafts  it kept going through my mind  This is not right  This is not what happened Gloria Lett  lead counsel with the OHEC  declined to comment and referred thePost to the Committee on House Administration The committee said that the OHECserves to provide advice to House employing offices on employment policies and practices  They added that ultimately  each member makes the final decision for how a case against the office is handled and an employees employment status Kain told thePostin an interview that she was so nervous about imperiling her bosss chance of reelection that she disconnected her phone from the Houses WiFi network to privately look up how to report harassment to the Ethics Committee Kain said  I was 24 and doing a job that I believed in for an institution I was proud to be a part of But I was being severely abused and had nowhere to turn  Nobody talked about things like this  I was suffering and thought it was weakness On May 5  Baker called Kain roughly 50 times and said he would find her and kill her  according to Kains harassment report Chris Martin  a National Republican Congressional Committee  NRCC  spokesman  called for Etsy to resign in a statement on Friday Martin said  Elizabeth Esty orchestrated one of the most disturbing Washington cover ups in recent memory  There is no place for someone who protects abusers in Congress  and she should resign immediately TheHartford Courantcalled for Rep  Etsy to resign in an editorial on Friday TheCourantwrote Ms  Esty says she was following the rules designed to protect the House as an institution rather than the victim  and she now regrets that She should regret it  It was a colossal failure of judgment and an indication that her priorities are awry  She was elected to represent constituents  not abusive men Perhaps most disturbing is that there is no evidence that the woman who was so concerned for her safety was ever formally involved in the deal to protect her alleged abuser Time was up for John Conyers And now  time is up for Elizabeth Esty The House Administration Committee revealed that nearly  200 000 had been allocated to a special fund in the last two decades to cover up congressional sexual harassment cases Several congressmen have resigned in the wake of new harassment charges Rep  Jon Conyers  D MI  retired in the wake of allegations by several women who claimed he made unwanted sexual advances towards him Conyers has denied any wrongdoing  despitereportsthat one former staffer was paid a  27 000 settlement for charges of sexual harassment in 2015 Sen  Al Franken  D MN  also resigned in December  facing several cases of sexual harassment  In his resignation speech  Frankencalledsome of his accusers liars  Some of the allegations against me are simply not true  Others I remember very differently Rep  Pat Meehan  R PA announcedthat he will not seekre election after reports revealed that he used taxpayer money to settle a sexual harassment case with a former staffer he called his soul mate The congresswoman  a perennial target for Republicans  was among the Democrats who called on their colleague Rep  John Conyers Jr   Mich  to resign after he was accused last fall of serially harassing female staff members Etsy charged in a statement in November after the House established mandatory anti harassment training for House offices  For too long  the culture in Washington has accepted entirely unacceptable behavior  That needs to change  period ,0
Rubio writes in the wake of the Parkland  Florida  shooting rampage by former Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student Nikolas Cruz  who killed 17 people and had not been arrested prior to the shooting despite multiple signs of aggressive or threatening behavior In the wake of the February 14  2018 horrific shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland  Florida  disturbing reports have indicated that federal guidance may have contributed to systemic failures to report Nikolas Cruzs dangerous behaviors to local law enforcement  the senator states In his letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos  Rubio refers to the Obama administrations 2014 Dear Colleague Letter that mapped out requirements for public school disciplinary policies that would put an end to the school to prison pipeline for minority students  The policy threatened schools with risk of losing federal funding if they showed higher numbers of referrals to law enforcement for minority students than for other students  even if the behaviors in question were unacceptable The guidance  writes Rubio  discouraged schools from referring students to local law enforcement The 2014 guidance encouraged schools to emphasize constructive interventions over certain disciplinary actions  the senator says  This guidance also states that school policies should  e nsure that school personnel understand that they  rather than school resource officers and other security or law enforcement personnel  are responsible for administering routine student discipline Rubio continues This policy allowed the Departments to initiate an investigation into schools and  if found to be noncompliant  could be at risk of losing federal funding  Further  the 2014 directive and subsequent guidance included onerous requirements and harsh penalties that arguably made it easier for schools to not report students to law enforcement than deal with the potential consequences The overarching goals of the 2014 directive to mitigate the school to prison pipeline  reduce suspensions and expulsions  and to prevent racially biased discipline are laudable and should be explored  However  any policy seeking to achieve these goals requires basic common sense and an understanding that failure to report troubled students  like Cruz  to law enforcement can have dangerous repercussions  The 2014 directive lacked such common sense  but the guidance can be revised to strike an appropriate balance that marries school safety with student discipline and counseling Broward County superintendent Robert Runcie has said little about his districts discipline policy in the aftermath of the shootings  The school district adopted the policy once Runcie left Chicago  where he once worked for Obama education secretary Arne Duncan  to become Broward County superintendent Runcie and Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel signed onto the policy  Within a year of Runcies arrival in Broward County  school arrests dropped dramatically by 66 percent Seeking to implement a similar nationwide policy  the Obama administration brought the Broward officials to Washington to propose their plan as a possible model for school districts across the country In Israels campaign video in 2012  the Democrat praises the ideology behind the school policy I am the sheriff who will measure the success of the agency by the young people were able to keep out of jail and not put in jail  while keeping our neighborhoods secure and making sure that were doing things the right way  Well end racial profiling  not curtail it  but end racial profiling  Well diversify the county  well look differently than each other  well think differently than each other  well have hybrid ideas  and most importantly well bring a cultural change to an agency thats in dire need of one Runcie is currently focused on praising students from his district who are now gun control activists  He touts that his school district prepared them for this activist role  In a tweet last week  the superintendent cited an article from Slate that praises comprehensive education that teaches students how to be political activists Why are the Parkland teens so good at this  Their public school prepared them for it     https t co YLk84y0YC2 via  slate  browardschools likes to boast that they have the best public education system in America   Read why they might be right    BrowardStrong  MSDStrong  Supt Runcie  RobertwRuncie  March 2  2018 The Slate piece also criticizes Rubio  who is described as scolding the student activists for being infected with arrogance and boasting ,0
Host Matt Boyle asked Rosendale about Schumers efforts to put  900 million in funding for the Gateway project into the omnibus spending bill  a project that now is estimated to cost federal taxpayers nearly  30 billion  despite initial estimates of just over  10 billion  The project would build a series of bridges and tunnels from Newark  New Jersey  into Manhattan in New York Citybut as Breitbart News exposed it has received no funding from the states of New York or New Jersey and is seeking to be funded entirely by the federal government  Trump has threatened to veto the omnibus if the projects funding is in the billand now Schumers efforts are causing negative political consequences for his vulnerable members up for re election this year  such as Montana Democrat Sen  Jon Tester Tester is one of ten Senate Democrats up for re election in 2018 in states where Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016 and one of the most vulnerable senators facing voters again  Now  Rosendale is hammering Tester for standing with Schumer and New York City against the people of Montanawho get no benefit from this project but are paying for it if Schumer gets his wayon the Gateway project  Rosendale is running on a pledge to stop the practice of giant omnibus spending bills filled with waste  fraud  and abuse of taxpayer moneybashing the big government process that led to this point This is something that Ive been talking about since I thought about politics and have engaged in the process going 37 years back  when I was 20 years old  Rosendale said on Breitbart News Sunday Rosendale called omnibus bills nothing more than Christmas trees that are great  big  fat pieces of pork The people of Montana want to send me to Washington  not to bring home the bacon  but to slaughter the hog  said Rosendale  who called for more single issue legislation that has to stand on its own merits He called out Schumer for consistently pushing spending increases Rosendale contrasted this to his time serving in finance and claims in the state legislature and proposing millions and millions of dollars of spending cuts each session  He said he did so both with and without Republican support  He added  In the last year when Ive been running this agency  Ive reduced my operating expenses by 23 percent  Thats what the people of Montana expect us to do Tester voted along with Schumer to shut down the government for a couple days in what became known as the Schumer Shutdown  The shutdown effort was so disastrous for Democrats politically that Schumer could not even last a full business day and completely caved to Republicans by midday into the first business day of the shutdownprompting leftist pro amnesty protesters to storm his residence in New York It wasnt about the nations budget  it was about Jon Testers campaign budget  Rosendale said of Testers vote for the Schumer Shutdown  He voted against the children of Montana  He voted against our nations military  to hold up this  instead of trying to support what they called at the time  the illegal immigrants Rosendale then brought up the Democrats refusal to make a deal with the president on DACA  citing it as proof that the shutdown vote was nothing more than a ploy to try and make the president look bad and to keep him from advancing his agenda  which has been very good for the people of the United States  and its been outstanding for the people of Montana Host Amanda House asked Rosendale to respond to Testers description of the GOP tax cut bill as one of the shittiest bills thats ever come in front of the Senate Rosendale said that the median income in Montana is  48 000 and that the vast majority of people in the state are seeing an increase in their income as a result of the tax cut bill Asked about the push for gun control  Rosendale recalled the 17 souls lost in the tragic Florida school mass murder in February and all others affected  He then called for good policy in response  thinking thoroughly through policy to have a positive impact  not simply knee jerk reaction  He spoke of participating in passing legislation in Montana to get treatment to those in the state suffering from mental illness Boyle recalled Testers vote for Obamacare in 2010  He asked Rosendale  as state auditor  what he is doing in Montana now to help residents with health care Rosendale said he focused on working on solutions that provided people with health care  not merely insurance  Welcoming healthcare sharing ministries into the state and authorizing primary care agreements were among the ways Rosendale said they accomplished this  These agreements involve a flat fee in exchange for a list of primary care offerings  He spoke of changes from the federal tax cut bill that has also opened up options for peoples healthcare needs Breitbart News Sundayairs Sundays on SiriusXMs Patriot channel 125 from 7 00 p m  to 10 00 p m  Eastern LISTEN Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter  MichelleDiana ,0

Boots admission  titled If this is what conservatism has become  count me out  came Sunday after years of articles in which he attacked President Donald Trump  disparaged the political Right more generally  and progressively conceded that he held a significant number of unambiguously leftist positions Justifying his original claim to conservatism on his affiliation with two New York based center right publications and his contribution to the bellicose foreign policy of three failed Republican presidential candidates  Boot writes In the past I would have been indignant at such attacks and eager to assert my conservative credentials  I spent years writing for conservative publications such as the Wall Street Journal editorial page and Commentary magazine and working as a foreign policy adviser for three Republican presidential campaigns  Being conservative used to be central to my identity  But now  frankly  I dont give a damn  I prefer to think of myself as a classical liberal  because conservative has become practically synonymous with Trump lackey Rubin  long the Posts resident voice for the Right despite there being no extant evidence of her identifying as a conservative or supporting the Republican Party before 2005  quickly endorsed Boots disavowal of conservatism Monday   I t is essential for Democrats to take one or both houses of Congress in the midterms  she writes Repeatedly referring to conservatives as they  Rubin describes CPAC attendees as a mob that now flaunts its intellectual vapidity and abject racism  because they booed Nation Review Never Trumper Mona Charens on stage insult of CPAC speaker Marion Marchal Le Pen and her family Boot  like other Never Trumpers  disavowed the single successful GOP presidential campaign since 2004 and endorsed Hillary Clinton  Instead  he served as aforeign policy adviser to the John McCain  Mitt Romney  and Marco Rubio campaigns in 2008  2012  and 2016 respectively All three losing campaigns espoused Boots signature unapologetically interventionist  stridently anti Russian  and self described imperialist foreign policy  perhaps best summed up in an aphorism he penned in 2003 as American troops mopped up the last Saddam Husseins Iraq and settled in for a bloody eight year civil war in which almost 4 500 of them would perish  It means imposing the rule of law  property rights  free speech and other guarantees  at gunpoint if need be   we shouldnt hesitate to impose our democratic views  he wrote Boot has never renounced his wholehearted support for the Iraq War and the project of imperialist democratic nation building  He  in fact  touts it as the primary proof of what he once considered his conservative bone fides  Im used to being vilified by the far left as a bloodthirsty neocon warmonger for the Original Sin of having supported the invasion of Iraq  he writes  adding that hes surprised to be considered a left winger Fittingly  Boots path to Sundays unequivocal declaration that he is not a conservative began over these issues on Tucker Carlsons Fox News program last summer  where Boot defended a comparison between Tucker and Nazi sympathizers because he was not sufficiently hawkish on Russia Still  at that point  considering himself a conservative  Boot went on to clarify that the Republican Party deserves to die  that he endorses the leftist doctrines of white privilege and male privilege  that he is pro abortion  that he supports transgenders in the military  and that he believes opposing amnesty or pushing for any reduction in mass immigration is offensive Since being hired full time by the Post on January 30  Boot has added that he wants a rethink of the Second Amendment that would ban the AR 15  Americas most popular rifle  which he apparently believes  unlike other rifles  has an exceptional ability to make peoples body parts explode Rubin  who has spent most of her output over the last week pushing gun control  had carved out a niche for herself as one the Lefts favorite conservatives  attacking President Trump and his supporters  even when they advanced positions she herself had years earlier  She too has now formally washed her hands of the conservative movement  Seeing the CPAC circus trample on the remnants of a serious political movement  I was struck by how the assemblage seemed terribly angry  thin skinned and so very mean spirited  she writes Having left conservatism  Rubin will join what Boot calls classical liberalism and what I conceive of as center right politics ' but not before she discards that most tenuous connection to the political right  tax cuts  because this new alignment require s  that we toss away some stale policy canards  e g  tax cuts for the rich are the cure to what ails us Rubin believes that she and Boots Never Trump classical liberalism may be powerful enough to upend party affiliation  policy preferences  the two party system itself  In parting with conservatism  Rubin tells us she is uplifted by the prospect of being aligned with people she admires and respects on the Left There is also something uplifting in making new political alliances  shedding some mistaken assumptions about the other side  defending the essence of American democracy and thinking outside the rigid strictures of partisan politics  And most of all  there is joy in doing so with people you admire and respect At time of print  Rubins Right Turn blog still ends with the post script that she offers reported opinion from a conservative perspective ,0
Standing here honoring the legacy of the great Mordechai Anielewicz  who together with 700 fighters held off the Nazis for an astonishing three weeks  I was disheartened to see a world famous Israeli born actress give aid and comfort to Israels enemies by boycotting the Jewish state On Friday  before the Sabbath  as I stood at the Gaza border witnessing brave Israel Defense Forces  IDF  soldiers repel the demonstrators of the Hamas genocidal terror organization  who seek to breach the border fence that keeps Israelis alive  I heard the news that Natalie Portman decided not to attend the ceremony where she was to be given the Genesis Prize Portman is a wonderful actress who has on rare occasions defended the country of her birth  I applaud her earlier solidarity with her people  But her cowardly decision to abandon Israel as it is fighting a war with terrorists trying to overrun its border  is shocking and hypocritical  It provides aid and comfort to Israels enemies  however unwittingly She is within her rights to criticize government policies  Thats what a democracy is all about  But the way she has chosen to do so  by boycotting Israel  has shown a disdain for democracy and a thoughtless disregard for the welfare of her people When the Genesis Foundation decided to bestow its prestigious prize on the Oscar winner  Portman originally responded to the prize enthusiastically  I am deeply touched and humbled by this honor  I am proud of my Israeli roots and Jewish heritage  they are crucial parts of who I am Now  just weeks before the Foundation was about to present her with the award at a gala  Portman announced she would not attend  When the news broke  it was immediately reported as a boycott of Israel and seized on by the antisemitic boycott  divestment and sanctions  BDS  movement as evidence that even famous Israelis view their country as uniquely deserving of demonization One thing celebrities seemingly care about more than anything is bad publicity  Perhaps she was worried going to Israel in the midst of tensions in Gaza would allow Israels detractors to paint her in a bad light  Nearly every artist who goes to Israel is pressured to boycott  and the cowardly ones  such as Lorde  cave into the antisemites After widespread criticism  and  perhaps realizing the gift she gave to Israel haters around the world  Portman tried to explain she was not boycotting Israel  I chose not to attend because I did not want to appear as endorsing Benjamin Netanyahu  who was to be giving a speech at the ceremony  she wrote on Instagram  Like many Israelis and Jews around the world  I can be critical of the leadership in Israel without wanting to boycott the entire nation  I treasure my Israeli friends and family  Israeli food  books  art  cinema  and dance Portmans words were too little  too late  and her behavior inexcusable Initially  it was reported she was upset by recent events  presumably meaning the protests in Gaza  Well  Natalie  unlike you  I was standing on the outskirts of Gaza  watching Hamas terrorists advancing on the border with the intent of crossing into Israel and murdering Jews  I watched the restraint used by Israeli troops  who used riot control measures practiced around the world to disperse the protestors What would you have Israel do  Natalie  Do you believe Israelis have the right to defend themselves against a terror mob armed with knives  guns and bombs  Did you watch the peaceful protestors placing improvised explosive devices along the fence  or the kites flown across the border with incendiary devices to set the agricultural fields on fire Did you speak out against the Hamas terrorists explicit call for the destruction of your homeland  or their charter  which calls for the murder of Jews around the globe If Portman wants to criticize Israeli policies  no one is stopping her  But for her to use the Israeli Prime Minister as an excuse for not attending a gala in her honor reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of Israel  a disdain for democracy  and disrespect for Israels leader  Portman neither has to like nor agree with Prime Minister Netanyahu  but she should understand that he was democratically elected by the people of Israel  not once  not twice  but four times As an Israeli citizen she is entitled to vote and to campaign in Israel against him if she disagrees  But to use her platform as an actress in America to delegitimize the views of the Israeli people is unforgivable I wonder if she has given any thought to the fact that if she wanted to criticize the leader of Hamas or the Palestinian Authority in front of them  she would be jailed  or worse  If Portman were really concerned about Palestinian rights  she would be denouncing their leaders for denying them freedom of speech  freedom of assembly  and freedom of the press  She should be speaking out against the widespread practice of honor killings by Palestinians against innocent women for simply having boyfriends  something unthinkable in Israel Portman also shows tremendous insensitivity to Israeli soldiers protecting their country when she  unlike most Israeli citizens  including two of my children  who as Americans did not have to serve  chose not to serve in the Israeli Army I do not judge her for doing so  but it would be pleasant to see her show some appreciation for the young heroes who don the olive green uniform and protect Israel from the genocidal plans of Hamas  Hezbollah  Iran  and ISIS  Natalie was happy to carry a gun and play a soldier defending the world in her latest movie  But life is not fiction  and she should be magnanimous in praising those young Israelis who put themselves in harms way so that Israeli buses and kindergartens are not blown to smithereens With great fame comes great responsibility  Portman should reverse course  accept the prize  and give any speech she deems fit  including one that might publicly challenge government policy  Thats all in keeping with democratic discourse But to boycott Israel is to trash her own country  undermine its democracy  and abet its implacable enemies Rabbi Shmuley Boteach  Americas Rabbi

This was the culmination of a process that began last September  when I first contacted Matt Schlapp of the American Conservative Union  ACU  CPACs sponsoring organization  and asked to become a CPAC sponsor so that I could host an event  I was willing to pay the full price for this sponsorship  CPAC did not allow that  but months later they did finally give me a room  and then put numerous obstacles in my way  finally pulling the plug altogether The deal they ultimately offered me came with a number of strings attached  One of their ACU sponsors  the American Principles Project  APP  had a room it was not using and would let us use it  But even then  this would not have been an event sponsored by AFDI  CPAC would not allow that  Instead  they said that my event had to be sponsored by the APP  a group I had never heard of before My unfamiliarity with the APP was of no import  The issue of social media censorship was paramount  the most critical issue facing conservatives today  So it was great news  We moved forward In nailing down the final details with CPAC  I put up with a great deal  CPAC officials put up oneroadblockafter another They gave us a room  but after we announced where the event would be  they told us that room was not available  They moved us from a room for 150 people to a room for 70 CPAC then told us that the featured speakers at my event would have to buy tickets to get in  and tickets were not cheap  running upwards of  300  Then late Tuesday night  I received a call from Terry Schilling  the ACU board member who runs the APP  demandingthat I remove one of the speakers from the panel  I refused A panel on free speech is not going to drop a speaker for saying something that offended the left It was Gateway Pundits Jim Hoft they wanted banned  because of his post on the Florida shooting arguing that some of the pro gun control students who got so much media attention had likely been coached  For that  Hoft was attacked by the likes of Chelsea Clinton and Paul Krugman  and CPAC folded Whenever a leftist is attacked  the left circles the wagons and defends its own  Whenever the left attacks a conservative  the establishment right throws that conservative to the wolves Yet our panel had generated enormous interest  It was the most talked about panel at CPAC  The announcement on Breitbart had thousands of comments SchillingtoldBreitbartNews that the cancelation was completely Pamelas call and completely avoidable Yet by banning a speaker  APP effectively canceledthe panel  They would not allow the panel without him  and they knew that I would never do the panel without him  They made it unavoidable Schilling also said  Im scrambling right now to put together a new panel on this  because she sabotaged it What is he talking about  They never had a panel  They had an empty room  Thats how it was offered to me  as an empty room in which I could put a panel discussion  It was a small available space that came with APPs CPAC sponsorship package  It was offered this past Sunday  APP had nothing going on  no new panel to put together  I organized the entire event The Breitbart article further quoted Schilling  I didnt want the entire conversation to be about Jim Hoft  And guess what  Now it is  Yet the APP signed off on Jim when I sent Schilling the entire speaker list on Monday  Even worse  Breitbart reports that Schilling acknowledged that Hoft had helped his father  Robert Schilling  in his successful run for Congress in 2010  notably  by exposing the incumbent Democrats lack of regard for the U S  Constitution  but said that personalities should not be the focus of the panel Schilling added  This has nothing to do with CPAC  This was my call Schilling is CPAC  he is an ACU board member  He and Dan Schneider cobbled together this last minute solution  And it was Schilling who made this all about Hoft  when Tucker Carlson and others have pointed out the same things Hoft has  CPAC is not going to throw Tucker under the bus  But Hoft and me  Sure This is just the latest in how CPAC has worked to sabotage true conservatives  Longtime Geller Report and AFDI members are familiar with my decade long struggle with CPAC  This years imbroglio is unlike how the conference has shut me out in previous years  After I hosted wildly successful events there every year from 2008 through 2012  they began to bar me  coming up each year with new excuses  Last year they even told me that I was being denied because of the negative press coverage I had previously given them over being barred in the years before that This is the panel that CPAC has now prevented from being held this year Suppression of Conservative Views on Social Media  A First Amendment Issue Major social media platforms such as Google  Twitter  Instagram  Facebook  and YouTube have created the new town square  having become the primary portals through which Americans receive news today  On these platform  the Left has a monopoly  The social media giants are moving actively to erase and hide any viewpoint or person that does not conform to the progressive values for which they stand This has resulted in massive losses of readership and revenue for conservative sites  and endangers the very freedom of our Republic by allowing only one point of view to be aired  The social media corporations today hold more power over the public discourse than any totalitarian regime ever held  They do not just target voices with whom they disagree  but they make sure that those voices are unable to sustain themselves This panel will discuss the magnitude of this phenomenon  and discuss ways that the power of these Leftist social media outlets can be limited  such that voices that dissent from the hard Left agenda can again be freely heard Panelists will include Pamela Geller  Editor and Publisher  Geller Report  President  American Freedom Defense Initiative  AFDI  and author ofFatwa  Hunted in America James Damore Google whistleblower HarmeetK  Dhillon  renowned free speech attorney Dan Gainor Vice President for Business and Culture  Media Research Center Jim Hoft  Editor in Chief  Gateway Pundit James OKeefe  Project Veritas Marlene Jaeckel Tech Entrepreneur CPAC has now joined with the left in this censorship Its ironic  In a conversation last week with Dan Schneider of the ACU  I asked that we bury the hatchet and said that we had to unify and have a big tent if we were to defeat our common enemy  I said that of course we wont agree on all issues  but thats not who we are  thats who the left is  marching in collectivist lockstep  I was respectful  deferential even  I was only concerned with the mission  to get this essential message to the grassroots  Those of us who have been at the front of the firing lines in the information battle space must communicate with like minded lovers of freedom  we must build an army  What could possibly be the motive of the ACU in blocking that Schneider told me that there were four qualifiers for acceptance and I passed them all  except thatI had been critical of CPACwithin the past year  I said that was a year ago  after the last CPAC  I was a couple of days before the one year deadline  And it couldnt be that CPAC did not permit dissent  He said of course it does  but CPACdidnt like my choice of words And clearly  with all the roadblocks they constructed to make sure my event this year wouldnt happen  they still dont like dissent This issue  the suppression of the freedom of speech on social media  affects all of us on the right  In fact  it is the most critical issue of the day  if we are stripped of the means to communicate with one another  its all over  It was free people speaking freely on social media  outside of the reach of the media establishment  that got Donald Trump elected President of the United States The Democrats were onto the power of social media with Obamas 2008 election  and here we are ten years later and the RINOs are still fighting not against the left  but against the most effective leaders on the right  The work my organization and I do is critical and singular  It addresses the most serious issues of our time  CPAC should be inviting us  not banning us Now the APP says theyre organizing the panel anyway  without either me or Hoft  In reality  I organized the panel and gave it its focus  the APP had no hand in it  This is the height of irony  a panel on free speech from which not one  but two speakers have been banned  How can they claim to stand for free speech after dropping a speaker because of pressure from the authoritarian left  What value can a free speech panel have when two free speech leaders were banned from that panel The panel is now bitterly ironic  Social media censorship discussed in a heavily censored event Conservatives are noticing what is happening with CPAC  and they arent happy  A new hit piece on CPAC inVanity Fairreveals that there are currently only 31 groups sponsoring the convention this year  compared to 47in 2017  and just 30 listed exhibitors  down from 44 grassroots activist groups the year before CPAC had lost nearly a third of its attendees from a peak of roughly 12 000 in 2014 We cannot accept the silencing of our colleagues  We can disagree  of course  and debate  But banning and shutting us down  No  thats what the left does  That is not who we are Pamela Geller is the President of the American Freedom Defense Initiative  AFDI  publisher of The Geller Report and author of

UPDATE tweet I will kill any tax legislation that benefits  Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with  NRA   Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back  Casey Cagle  CaseyCagle  February 26  2018 Atlanta based Delta was set to get a  40 million per year tax break on jet fuel from the Georgia legislature  something establishment Chamber of Commerce backed GOP Gov  Nathan Deal supports handing out  But when Delta yanked its relationship with the NRA after the Parkland shooting  conservatives in Georgia have risen up against the airlines efforts to procure this big government handout I decided to take action against Delta and the way they align with the left in going after the NRA and its members  Debbie Dooley  an influential Atlanta based Tea Party leader  told Breitbart News Sunday on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125  Donald Trump tweeted out something I will always remember  I think it was in 2015  He said when somebody challenges you unfairly  fight back  Be brutal  Be tough  That is what were going to have to be to fight for his agenda and to fight for the Second Amendment  If youre in Georgia  I found out that Delta Airlines is asking for a  40 million per year tax break on jet fuel  and I realize the best way that we can be effective and the best way we can combat the boycotts and threats of the left is to hit them  Go after their subsidies  Go after their tax breaks that theyre receiving on the state level  and take it away from them  If were successful in stopping Deltas tax subsidies  we will have cost them  200 million in five years  I think thats something thats important that we replicate in other states Delta  this past week  tweeted that it was cutting off its relationship with the NRA Delta is reaching out to the NRA to let them know we will be ending their contract for discounted rates through our group travel program  We will be requesting that the NRA remove our information from their website  Delta  Delta  February 24  2018 In response  Dooleya key organizer on the right with top conservatives nationally and in Georgiasent out an email to thousands of conservatives across Georgia  imploring Republicans in the state legislature and the governor and lieutenant governor to stand up for the Second Amendment and Constitution of the United States against Delta by blocking the subsidy We can have an impact  Dooley told Breitbart News Sunday  imploring conservatives across Georgia and around the United States to step up and get involved  There was some Democrats in Clayton County  which is one of the poorer counties in Georgia  that would be negatively impacted if Delta did not have to pay  40 million in gasoline tax  Youre talking about the county schools in Clayton County  the County government  So you already have Democrats opposing this  I just felt this is the best way to have an immediate impact  and were going after them  It was smooth sailing  I found out about it and sent out an email yesterday afternoonI think it was about 2 20  And boy  all heck broke loose after I sent the email out  The email went out to 10 000 hard core activists in Georgia  and the email went to the state legislators  It also went to the business community in Georgia  And Delta then began to realize what they had done  and they started trying to saytheir chief lobbyist sent out a tweet saying Delta was not trying to attack the Second Amendment  Were pro Second Amendment  We were just trying to be neutral David Werner  a former staffer for Gov  Deal who is now a Delta lobbyist  is the one who made the statement falsely claiming that the airline does support the Second Amendment and the Constitution of the United States Delta announcement this morning was not a political statement it was the opposite    Delta merely confirmed its neutral status on a politically and emotionally charged issue by removing its name from the debate  David Werner  davidrosswerner  February 24  2018 Delta continues to support the 2nd Amendment  Atlanta based airline tries to staunch fallout over its decision to sever ties with  NRA https t co jsIOWUhZlA  gapol pic twitter com hw1TwDsZgU  Greg Bluestein  bluestein  February 25  2018 That comment from Werner is obviously a lie  however  since Delta did take a stand against the Second Amendment and the United States Constitution by cutting its ties with the NRA  In fact  Deltas own statement on its own website admits it was a political decision to cut ties with the NRA Delta informed the National Rifle Association Saturday that the airline will end its contract for discounted fares for travel to the associations 2018 annual meeting  The company requested that the NRA remove Deltas information from its meeting website  Delta saidon its website  adding Deltas decision reflects the airlines neutral status in the current national debate over gun control amid recent school shootings  Out of respect for our customers and employees on both sides  Delta has taken this action to refrain from entering this debate and focus on its business  Delta continues to support the 2nd Amendment  This is not the first time Delta has withdrawn support over a politically and emotionally charged issue  Last year  Delta withdrew its sponsorship of a theater that staged a graphic interpretation of Julius Caesar depicting the assassination of President Trump  Delta supports all of its customers but will not support organizations on any side of any highly charged political issue that divides our nation Dooley noted that there are consequences for Deltas decisions to engage in extremist political actions against the NRA and the Second Amendment  Until Delta withdraws its attacks on the Constitution and reinstates its relationship with the NRA  Dooley says  it is unlikely that any Republicans in the Georgia State Senate could in good conscience give it this tax break Up until Delta sent out that tweet  Gov  Deals former counselhis attorneywent to be a lobbyist  left the governors office  and was hired by Delta to be a lobbyist to push this through  Dooley said  They attached it to a tax reform bill  It sailed through the House  and it was in the Senate  Lt  Gov  Casey Cagle  who is running for governor  was guiding it through the Senate  Delta was prodding him to rush it up  to go through and waive the rules in the Senate so they could go ahead and vote on it  Well  we now know why they were doing that  they knew what they were going to do about the NRA  Theres a state senator named Michael Williams  a big Trump guyhe was the Trump campaign guy in Georgia  the campaign chairman  and he stood up and he said no  He stopped them from doing that  He and a hard core group of conservative senators after all this broke  after my email went out  are trying to put pressure on Lt  Gov  Cagle to recommit the tax cut bill to the Senate Finance Committee so they can amend it and remove Deltas tax cut  We need to put pressure on Gov  Deal and Lt  Gov  Casey Cagle and peoples state senators and let them know that a vote for this corporate subsidy is a vote against our Second Amendment rights and against the NRA Dooley said she laughed at Deltas statement  too  It remains to be seen when the vote may happen  but it is heating up in Georgias statehouse right now Delta is going to push for their tax breaks  and they are not going to back down  Dooley said  This is a fight we can win  This is a stand in Georgia we can take that will send a warning shot to other major corporations that says  Dont even think about doing this because were coming for you if you do  And were going to hurt  hit you so hard in your pocketbook that youre going to think twice about it because were going to take away your corporate giveaways LISTEN TO DEBBIE DOOLEY ON BREITBART NEWS SUNDAY ,0
From first to last  Abbas relied on inventing or revising history  tampering with facts and data  making misleading statements  and engaging in pure fantasy that can only be appreciated by examining his speech in some detail Among Abbas statements  the following  in particular  stand out Seventy years have passed since Palestines Naqba  from which 6 million Palestine refugees continue to suffer from the cruelty of exile and loss of human security  They continue to wander the world after the loss of their peaceful and stable lives in their homeland Except that the so called naqba was brought about at Arab  not Jewish  instigation  Specifically  it was created by the Palestinian Arab and neighboring Arab states decision to resort to war in rejection of the U N  General Assembly partition resolution of November 29  1947  which sought to create Arab and Jewish states in Palestine  supposedly  exactly what Mahmoud Abbas and the PA want now  The Palestinian Arabs were not displaced by Israels emergence in May 1948  they were displaced by the war to which they resorted in an effort to abort Israel The  Palestinians  whose country has not yet been recognized as full Member State of the United Nations  despite the numerous resolutions reaffirming their right to self determination and statehood on their national land No Palestinian Arab state has emerged because the PA has repeatedly rejected offers of statehood in virtually all Judea Samaria and Gaza  in 2000 2001  when then Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak offered his peace plan  later enlarged in the Palestinians favor by President Bill Clintons parameters  and again in 2008  when then Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert proposed an even more generous version of the 2001 plan to Abbas  In both cases  the PA rejected the proposals without counter offer  while in 2000  it actually responded by launching a wave of terrorism against Israelis that claimed the lives of 1 500 Israeli civilians and caused the wounding and maiming off thousands more We are the descendants of the Canaanites that lived in the land of Palestine 5 000 years ago and continuously remained there to this day This is another absurd lie  akin to other fraudulent PA claims made from time to time  such as asserting that Canaanites built Solomons Temple and that Bedouin were the real ancient Hebrews  It is also similar in quality to Yasser Arafats absurd claim in a 1994 speech that Palestinian Arabs were descended from the Canaanite king Salem  a figure unknown to history  These amount to nothing less than a concerted effort  based on bare faced falsehoods to the international community by Abbas and the PA  to appropriate and falsify Jewish history in order to deny it  while inventing an utterly fictitious  pre Jewish Palestinian history in Jerusalem and the land of Israel The Balfour Declaration issued by the British Government in 1917  by which those who did not own  giving to those who had no right  The British Government bears responsibility for the catastrophic consequences inflicted on the Palestinian people as a result The Balfour Declaration was made on behalf of Britain  the power that actually fought and conquered the territories of the Ottoman empire  the previous sovereign  and was one of several plans for introducing independence to both Arabs and Jews in the former Ottoman territories  Palestine  an under populated territory with substantial Jewish and Christian minority populations  was earmarked  along with Lebanon and its majority Christian population  for non Muslim rule in accordance with the principle of self determination  the organizing principle of the post First World War world  which sought to ensure that even small peoples could enjoy sovereignty Abbass insistence that Jews had no right to their sovereign state in the biblical Jewish homeland ignores the principle of self determination  the very principle on which he demands Palestinian statehood  He also ignores that fact that the right of Jews to settle and establish their national home in Palestine was recognized by the Sharifians and the kingdom of the Hejaz  the Arab forces that contributed to the removal of Ottoman authority in the region and represented the Arab peoples at the post war conferences which ushered in the creation of numerous Arab states  Subsequent plans for sharing Palestine and for separate states during the subsequent British Mandate  1920 1948  all failed for one reason  Palestinian Arab rejection because all these plans encompassed sharing the land with the Jews Our national institutions are recognized by international organizations for their merit and work  which is based on the rule of law  accountability and transparency  and empowerment of women and youth in an environment of tolerance  coexistence of civilizations and nondiscrimination The PA is saturated with the promotion of hatred and incitement to violence in its controlled media  mosques  schools  and youth camps  The PA has been a political Enron  absorbing the worlds largest per capita foreign aid  much of it channeled into manufacturing weaponry prohibited under the Oslo Accords and arming terrorist groups which have flourished in PA territories since the establishment of the PA in 1994  The PA has not only educated Palestinian Arab schoolchildren to seek a violent death killing Jews as the highest national and religious duty  but continues to this day  despite criticism and pressure from President Donald Trump and other leaders  to pay salaries to blood soaked Jew killing terrorists in Israeli jails and stipends to the families of dead terrorists Palestinian Arab women have been empowered  to become suicide bombers alongside men  PA terrorist groups  like the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades and the Tanzim played prominent roles in the terrorist war against Israel launched by Yasser Arafat in 2000 following the failure of the Camp David peace summit  Others  like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad  operated openly and without hindrance within PA controlled territories  Eventually  the US  and EU recognized terrorist group Hamas actually managed to seize Gaza from the PA in 2007  Rule of law  accountability and transparency are about the last things that leap to mind when reviewing the record of Abbas and the PA W e continue to strive to unite our people and land and to ensure one authority  one law  and one gun  and are determined to convene parliamentary and presidential elections  We have  been committed to fostering a culture of peace  rejection of violence  pursuit of sustainable development and the building of schools  hospitals  industrial zones  agricultural farms and technological production  as opposed to establishing weapons factories and purchasing tanks and fighter jets  for we wish for our people to live in freedom and dignity The PA has been divided since Hamas overthrew the Abbas  Fatah dominated PA and seized control of Gaza in 2007  Numerous reconciliation attempts have failed while several actual reconciliation agreements since that date have proved dead letters  Abbas himself is in the thirteenth year of a five year presidential term  having refused to call elections since 2005 while the even more extreme and genocidally minded Hamas  which calls in its Covenant for the global murder of Jews  won parliamentary elections in 2006  PA textbooks continue to incite hatred and irredentism among Palestinian Arab schoolchildren  PA maps  atlases and stationary pretend Israel doesnt exist  and streets  schools  and sports teams are named in honor of blood soaked  Jew killing terrorists  like Dalal Mughrabi  who led the Fatah terrorists who carried out the 1978 coastal road massacre in which 38 Israelis  including 13 children  were slaughtered  Town squares  schools and competitions have been named in Mughrabis honor by the PA We engaged with all seriousness  in peace talks  with former Secretary of State John Kerry This is an interesting way to describe the 2014 peace talks  of which President Obamas chief negotiator  Martin Indyk  no fan of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his ruling Likud Party said  Netanyahu moved to the zone of possible agreement  I saw him sweating bullets to find a way to reach an agreement  whereas  We tried to get Abu Mazen  Abbas  to the zone of possible agreement but we were surprised to learn he had shut down The Israeli Governments intransigence caused the failure of all of these efforts  diplomatic initiatives and talks over the past quarter century In fact  Israel signed agreements and made huge concessions in the various talks Abbas specifically mentioned  the Oslo Accords  Wye River  Camp David  of assets  powers  territory  and even arms to the PA  which were later turned on Israelis  Yet  Abbas makes the audacious  dishonest claim  After all of this  how can it be said that it is we who reject negotiations Is it logical that Israel violates its obligation to implement resolutions 181  II  and 194  III  the implementation of which Israels admission to the UN was conditioned upon  as pledged in writing by its Foreign Minister Moshe Sharett  sic  at that time Here  Abbas tactfully fails to mention that it was the Zionist movement that accepted Resolution 181  the November 29  1947  partition resolution  whereas the Palestinian Arab movement rejected it completely  while Resolution 194  which speaks of the right of Palestine Arab refugees to return to Israel within the context of a proper peace settlement  was rejected by all Arab parties at the time   Israel was not yet a U N  member and therefore did not vote  but was opposed to several aspects of the resolution Israel is acting as a State above the law  It has transformed the occupation from a temporary situation as per international law into a situation of permanent settlement colonization and has imposed a one State reality of Apartheid  It has closed all doors to realizing the two State solution on the basis of the 1967 borders Israel has repeatedly agreed to peace plans  in 2000 2001  2008  to create a Palestinian Arab state on virtually all the territories officially claimed by the PA only for the PA to refuse them without counter offer  Israeli Arabs are full citizens of Israel while that tiny minority of Palestinian Arabs in the territories still living under Israeli jurisdiction  some 98 percent of Palestinian Arabs live under PA rule in Judea Samaria and Hamas rule in Gaza  are treated in accordance with the applicable rules governing lawful occupation  This is the very opposite of apartheid This  Trump  administration has not clarified its position  Is it for the two State solution  or for one State  And  then  in a dangerous  unprecedented manner  this administration undertook an unlawful decision  which was rejected by the international community  to remove the issue of Jerusalem off the table and to recognize the City as Israels capital and to transfer its embassy to the City The Trump administration has been perfectly clear in affirming that it favors any political solution which commands the support of both Israel and the PA  whether or not that involves the creation of a Palestinian Arab state  As President Trump put it in his statement recognizing Jerusalem as Israels capital city  We are not taking a position of any final status issues including the specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem or the resolution of contested borders  Those questions are up to the parties involved Similarly  the Trump administration has obeyed U S  law and not violated any international law in recognizing the obvious fact that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel  To the contrary  its recognition rights a wrong  whereby even the western part of Jerusalem that falls within the 1949 armistice lines was not previously recognized as sovereign Israeli territory as it should have been  Such recognition  as President Trump and Vice President Pence have repeatedly made crystal clear  does not prejudge or predetermine the outcome of any negotiations over Jerusalem that might one day take place between the parties We come here before your august Council in the midst of the deadlock of the peace process due to the US decision regarding Jerusalem  Israels ongoing illegal settlement activities  its violation of the resolutions of this Council  and its disrespect of the signed agreements This is an almost complete inversion of the truth  the deadlock in negotiations did not commence with President Trumps December 2017 announcement on Jerusalem  but it has been going since 2009  excepting one week and two meetings that the PA attended since that date  The reason has been Abbass refusal to participate in any talks without preconditions  Moreover  no new or additional deadlock was occasioned by President Trumps announcement  rather  Abbas and the PA chose to refuse all talks  indeed  even to meet American diplomats to discuss convening talks and peace proposals because of their displeasure with President Trumps announcement  That Palestinian Arab choice does not make President Trumps announcement any sort of cause of adeadlock Unsurprisingly  Abbas proposed convening an international conference aimed at establishing a Palestinian state without the PA and Palestinian Arab society undergoing any of the reforms and changes that would be necessary to secure a genuine peace into the future and then left the Security Council chamber This was not serious diplomacy  In fact  this amounts to the rejection of negotiations and any idea of a process of give and take Such a speech leaves open no conclusion other than Abbass absolute unwillingness to negotiate directly with Israel or reach any sort of agreement that does not encompass Israels ultimate elimination  Such an agreement will have to await a new leader and a new generation before we can

Though Zuckerberg addresses controversies surrounding the social networks alleged mishandling of user data  he also uses the speech to discuss alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U S  presidential election and how he plans to crack down on hate speech In the prepared testimony  Zuckerberg praised Facebooks ability to make voices heard  and all the good that connecting people can bring  while the Facebook CEO cited  MeToo and the anti gun March For Our Lives as positive movements that the social network helped to create Just recently  weve seen the  metoo movement and the March for Our Lives  organized  at least in part  on Facebook  he declared  before apologizing for not doing enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm  such as fake news  foreign interference in elections  and hate speech  as well as developers and data privacy It was my mistake  and Im sorry  I started Facebook  I run it  and Im responsible for what happens here  he continued  adding  Its not enough to just connect people  we have to make sure those connections are positive  Its not enough to just give people a voice  we have to make sure they arent using it to hurt people or spread misinformation In the prepared speech  Zuckerberg continued to explain his version of events surrounding the Cambridge Analytica controversy  before revealing what Facebook is doing about it  and boasts about having interfered with the online aspects of the 2017 presidential elections in France and Germany  and the U S  Senate Alabama election last year In France  leading up to the presidential election in 2017  we found and took down 30 000 fake accounts  In Germany  before the 2017 elections  we worked directly with the election commission to learn from them about the threats they saw and to share information  he explained  In the U S  Senate Alabama special election last year  we deployed new AI tools that proactively detected and removed fake accounts from Macedonia trying to spread misinformation From now on  every advertiser who wants to run political or issue ads will need to be authorized  To get authorized  advertisers will need to confirm their identity and location  Zuckerberg claimed  Any advertiser who doesnt pass will be prohibited from running political or issue ads  We will also label them and advertisers will have to show you who paid for them  Were starting this in the U S  and expanding to the rest of the world in the coming months Facebookrevealedlast week that up to 87 million users allegedly had their data improperly shared Zuckerberg is set to appear before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday  April 11 On Tuesday  April 10  one day before his hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee  Zuckerberg will also appear before the Senate Judiciary and Senate Commerce Committee A report discovered that Facebook has previously donated to 46 out of 55 of the members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee You can read Zuckerbergs full testimony below Chairman Walden  Ranking Member Pallone  and Members of the Committee We face a number of important issues around privacy  safety  and democracy  and you will rightfully have some hard questions for me to answer  Before I talk about the steps were taking to address them  I want to talk about how we got here Facebook is an idealistic and optimistic company  For most of our existence  we focused on all the good that connecting people can bring  As Facebook has grown  people everywhere have gotten a powerful new tool to stay connected to the people they love  make their voices heard  and build communities and businesses  Just recently  weve seen the  metoo movement and the March for Our Lives  organized  at least in part  on Facebook  After Hurricane Harvey  people raised more than  20 million for relief  And more than 70 million small businesses now use Facebook to grow and create jobs But its clear now that we didnt do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well  That goes for fake news  foreign interference in elections  and hate speech  as well as developers and data privacy  We didnt take a broad enough view of our responsibility  and that was a big mistake  It was my mistake  and Im sorry  I started Facebook  I run it  and Im responsible for what happens here So now we have to go through every part of our relationship with people and make sure were taking a broad enough view of our responsibility Its not enough to just connect people  we have to make sure those connections are positive  Its not enough to just give people a voice  we have to make sure people arent using it to hurt people or spread misinformation  Its not enough to give people control of their information  we have to make sure developers theyve given it to are protecting it too  Across the board  we have a responsibility to not just build tools  but to make sure those tools are used for good It will take some time to work through all of the changes we need to make  but Im committed to getting it right That includes improving the way we protect peoples information and safeguard elections around the world  Here are a few key things were doing II  CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA Over the past few weeks  weve been working to understand exactly what happened with Cambridge Analytica and taking steps to make sure this doesnt happen again  We took important actions to prevent this from happening again today four years ago  but we also made mistakes  theres more to do  and we need to step up and do it A  What Happened In 2007  we launched the Facebook Platform with the vision that more apps should be social  Your calendar should be able to show your friends birthdays  your maps should show where your friends live  and your address book should show their pictures  To do this  we enabled people to log into apps and share who their friends were and some information about them In 2013  a Cambridge University researcher named Aleksandr Kogan created a personality quiz app  It was installed by around 300 000 people who agreed to share some of their Facebook information as well as some information from their friends whose privacy settings allowed it  Given the way our platform worked at the time this meant Kogan was able to access some information about tens of millions of their friends In 2014  to prevent abusive apps  we announced that we were changing the entire platform to dramatically limit the Facebook information apps could access  Most importantly  apps like Kogans could no longer ask for information about a persons friends unless their friends had also authorized the app  We also required developers to get approval from Facebook before they could request any data beyond a users public profile  friend list  and email address  These actions would prevent any app like Kogans from being able to access as much Facebook data today In 2015  we learned from journalists at The Guardian that Kogan had shared data from his app with Cambridge Analytica  It is against our policies for developers to share data without peoples consent  so we immediately banned Kogans app from our platform  and demanded that Kogan and other entities he gave the data to  including Cambridge Analytica  formally certify that they had deleted all improperly acquired data  which they ultimately did Last month  we learned from The Guardian  The New York Times and Channel 4 that Cambridge Analytica may not have deleted the data as they had certified  We immediately banned them from using any of our services  Cambridge Analytica claims they have already deleted the data and has agreed to a forensic audit by a firm we hired to investigate this  Were also working with the U K  Information Commissioners Office  which has jurisdiction over Cambridge Analytica  as it completes its investigation into what happened B  What We Are Doing We have a responsibility to make sure what happened with Kogan and Cambridge Analytica doesnt happen again  Here are some of the steps were taking  Safeguarding our platform  We need to make sure that developers like Kogan who got access to a lot of information in the past cant get access to as much information going forward  We made some big changes to the Facebook platform in 2014 to dramatically restrict the amount of data that developers can access and to proactively review the apps on our platform  This makes it so a developer today cant do what Kogan did years ago  But theres more we can do here to limit the information developers can access and put more safeguards in place to prevent abuse Were removing developers access to your data if you havent used their app in three months  Were reducing the data you give an app when you approve it to only your name  profile photo  and email address  Thats a lot less than apps can get on any other major app platform  Were requiring developers to not only get approval but also to sign a contract that imposes strict requirements in order to ask anyone for access to their posts or other private data  Were restricting more APIs like groups and events  You should be able to sign into apps and share your public information easily  but anything that might also share other peoples information  like other posts in groups youre in or other people going to events youre going to  will be much more restricted  Two weeks ago  we found out that a feature that lets you look someone up by their phone number and email was abused  This feature is useful in cases where people have the same name  but it was abused to link peoples public Facebook information to a phone number they already had  When we found out about the abuse  we shut this feature down  Investigating other apps  Were in the process of investigating every app that had access to a large amount of information before we locked down our platform in 2014  If we detect suspicious activity  well do a full forensic audit  And if we find that someone is improperly using data  well ban them and tell everyone affected  Building better controls  Finally  were making it easier to understand which apps youve allowed to access your data  This week we started showing everyone a list of the apps youve used and an easy way to revoke their permissions to your data  You can already do this in your privacy settings  but were going to put it at the top of News Feed to make sure everyone sees it  And we also told everyone whose Facebook information may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica Beyond the steps we had already taken in 2014  I believe these are the next steps we must take to continue to secure our platform III  RUSSIAN ELECTION INTERFERENCE Facebooks mission is about giving people a voice and bringing people closer together  Those are deeply democratic values and were proud of them  I dont want anyone to use our tools to undermine democracy  Thats not what we stand for We were too slow to spot and respond to Russian interference  and were working hard to get better  Our sophistication in handling these threats is growing and improving quickly  We will continue working with the government to understand the full extent of Russian interference  and we will do our part not only to ensure the integrity of free and fair elections around the world  but also to give everyone a voice and to be a force for good in democracy everywhere A  What Happened Elections have always been especially sensitive times for our security team  and the 2016 U S  presidential election was no exception Our security team has been aware of traditional Russian cyber threats  like hacking and malware  for years  Leading up to Election Day in November 2016  we detected and dealt with several threats with ties to Russia  This included activity by a group called APT28  that the U S  government has publicly linked to Russian military intelligence services But while our primary focus was on traditional threats  we also saw some new behavior in the summer of 2016 when APT28 related accounts  under the banner of DC Leaks  created fake personas that were used to seed stolen information to journalists  We shut these accounts down for violating our policies After the election  we continued to investigate and learn more about these new threats  What we found was that bad actors had used coordinated networks of fake accounts to interfere in the election  promoting or attacking specific candidates and causes  creating distrust in political institutions  or simply spreading confusion  Some of these bad actors also used our ads tools We also learned about a disinformation campaign run by the Internet Research Agency  IRA   a Russian agency that has repeatedly acted deceptively and tried to manipulate people in the US  Europe  and Russia  We found about 470 accounts and pages linked to the IRA  which generated around 80 000 Facebook posts over about a two year period Our best estimate is that approximately 126 million people may have been served content from a Facebook Page associated with the IRA at some point during that period  On Instagram  where our data on reach is not as complete  we found about 120 000 pieces of content  and estimate that an additional 20 million people were likely served it Over the same period  the IRA also spent approximately  100 000 on more than 3 000 ads on Facebook and Instagram  which were seen by an estimated 11 million people in the United States  We shut down these IRA accounts in August 2017 B  What We Are Doing Theres no question that we should have spotted Russian interference earlier  and were working hard to make sure it doesnt happen again  Our actions include  Building new technology to prevent abuse  Since 2016  we have improved our techniques to prevent nation states from interfering in foreign elections  and weve built more advanced AI tools to remove fake accounts more generally  There have been a number of important elections since then where these new tools have been successfully deployed  For example  In France  leading up to the presidential election in 2017  we found and took down 30 000 fake accounts  In Germany  before the 2017 elections  we worked directly with the election commission to learn from them about the threats they saw and to share information  In the U S  Senate Alabama special election last year  we deployed new AI tools that proactively detected and removed fake accounts from Macedonia trying to spread misinformation  We have disabled thousands of accounts tied to organized  financially motivated fake news spammers  These investigations have been used to improve our automated systems that find fake accounts  Last week  we took down more than 270 additional pages and accounts operated by the IRA and used to target people in Russia and Russian speakers in countries like Azerbaijan  Uzbekistan and Ukraine  Some of the pages we removed belong to Russian news organizations that we determined were controlled by the IRA  Significantly increasing our investment in security  We now have about 15 000 people working on security and content review  Well have more than 20 000 by the end of this year  Ive directed our teams to invest so much in security  on top of the other investments were making  that it will significantly impact our profitability going forward  But I want to be clear about what our priority is  protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits  Strengthening our advertising policies  We know some Members of Congress are exploring ways to increase transparency around political or issue advertising  and were happy to keep working with Congress on that  But we arent waiting for legislation to act  From now on  every advertiser who wants to run political or issue ads will need to be authorized  To get authorized  advertisers will need to confirm their identity and location  Any advertiser who doesnt pass will be prohibited from running political or issue ads  We will also label them and advertisers will have to show you who paid for them  Were starting this in the U S  and expanding to the rest of the world in the coming months  For even greater political ads transparency  we have also built a tool that lets anyone see all of the ads a page is running  Were testing this in Canada now and well launch it globally this summer  Were also creating a searchable archive of past political ads  We will also require people who manage large pages to be verified as well  This will make it much harder for people to run pages using fake accounts  or to grow virally and spread misinformation or divisive content that way  In order to require verification for all of these pages and advertisers  we will hire thousands of more people  Were committed to getting this done in time for the critical months before the 2018 elections in the U S  as well as elections in Mexico  Brazil  India  Pakistan and elsewhere in the next year  These steps by themselves wont stop all people trying to game the system  But they will make it a lot harder for anyone to do what the Russians did during the 2016 election and use fake accounts and pages to run ads  Election interference is a problem thats bigger than any one platform  and thats why we support the Honest Ads Act  This will help raise the bar for all political advertising online  Sharing information  Weve been working with other technology companies to share information about threats  and were also cooperating with the U S  and foreign governments on election integrity At the same time  its also important not to lose sight of the more straightforward and larger ways Facebook plays a role in elections In 2016  people had billions of interactions and open discussions on Facebook that may never have happened offline  Candidates had direct channels to communicate with tens of millions of citizens  Campaigns spent tens of millions of dollars organizing and advertising online to get their messages out further  And we organized get out the vote efforts that helped more than 2 million people register to vote who might not have voted otherwise Security  including around elections  isnt a problem you ever fully solve  Organizations like the IRA are sophisticated adversaries who are constantly evolving  but well keep improving our techniques to stay ahead  And well also keep building tools to help more people make their voices heard in the democratic process IV  CONCLUSION My top priority has always been our social mission of connecting people  building community and bringing the world closer together  Advertisers and developers will never take priority over that as long as Im running Facebook I started Facebook when I was in college  Weve come a long way since then  We now serve more than 2 billion people around the world  and every day  people use our services to stay connected with the people that matter to them most  I believe deeply in what were doing  And when we address these challenges  I know well look back and view helping people connect and giving more people a voice as a positive force in the world I realize the issues were talking about today arent just issues for Facebook and our community  theyre challenges for all of us as Americans  Thank you for having me here today  and Im ready to take your questions Charlie Nash
